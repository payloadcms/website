## Security Checks

To ensure the security of the codebase, we have integrated security checks using `bandit` and `safety`. These tools help identify potential security issues in the code and dependencies.

### Running Security Checks

Before submitting any code, please run the following security checks:

1. **Bandit**: A tool to find common security issues in Python code.
   ```bash
   bandit -r droidrun
   ```

2. **Safety**: A tool to check your installed dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.
   ```bash
   safety scan
   ```
