          <h2>Data and User Content</h2>
          <p>
            You are solely responsible for all code, information, files, software, text and other
            materials and content (“Your Data”) that is uploaded, installed, transmitted, or
            otherwise sent (“Send(ing)”) to in connection with our Services. You ensure that Your
            Data, and your use of it, complies with this Agreement and any applicable law. Payload
            reserves the right to access your account and Your Data for the purpose of providing
            technical support at your request.
          </p>

          <p>
            By Sending Your Data on or through our Services you grant Payload a non-exclusive,
            royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable license to use, copy, modify,
            reproduce, distribute, display, publish Your Data only in connection with its provision
            of the Services and for security to protect the Services and third parties from fraud,
            malware, malicious files or content, viruses and the like.
          </p>

          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>
            It is your responsibility to protect your account information, including username and
            password to protect your own data from unauthorized access, security breaches, and other
            mishandling from other users. No person who is representative of Payload will ask you
            for your password.
          </p>

          <p>
            You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Services and taking your own
            steps to maintain appropriate security, protection and backup of Your Data. You are
            responsible for all activities in your account and Your Data, regardless of whether
            undertaken by you, your employees or a third party (including contractors or agents). We
            and our affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized access to your account and Your
            Data unless caused by our breach of this Agreement. You will contact us immediately if
            you believe unauthorized activity has occurred in your account or if your account
            information is lost or stolen.
          </p>

          <h2>No Warranty</h2>
          <p>
            The Services are provided on an AS IS and AS AVAILABLE basis and with no representation
            or warranty of any kind. Except to the extent prohibited by law, we disclaim any implied
            or statutory warranty, including any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for
            a particular purpose, and any warranty arising out of any course of dealing or usage of
            trade.
          </p>
          <h2>Indemnification</h2>
          <p>
            You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates and licensors, and each
            of their respective employees, officers, directors, and representatives from and against
            any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable
            legal fees) arising out of or relating to any third party claim concerning: (a) your use
            of the Services (including any activities under your account and use by your employees
            and personnel); (b) breach of this Agreement or violation of applicable law by you; or
            (c) your data or the combination of your data with other applications, content or
            processes, including any claim involving alleged infringement or misappropriation of
            intellectual property rights. If we or our affiliates are obligated to respond to a
            third party subpoena or other compulsory legal order or process seeking information
            related to your data or your use of the Services, you will also reimburse us for
            reasonable legal fees, as well as our employees’ and contractors’ time and materials
            spent responding to the third party subpoena or other compulsory legal order or process
            at our then-current hourly rates. We will promptly notify you of any claim subject to
            this Section, but our failure to promptly notify you will only affect your obligations
            to the extent that our failure materially harms your ability to defend the claim. You
            may: (a) use counsel of your own choosing (subject to our written consent) to defend
            against any claim; and (b) settle the claim as you deem appropriate, provided that you
            obtain our prior written consent before entering into any settlement.
          </p>
          <h2>Liability</h2>
          <p>
            We will not be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or
            exemplary damages (including damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use or data). We and
            our affiliates and licensors will not be responsible for any compensation, reimbursement
            or direct damages arising in connection with: (a) your inability to use the Services;
            (b) the cost of procurement of substitute goods or services; (c) any investments,
            expenditures or commitments by you in connection with this Agreement or your use of or
            access to the Services; or (d) any unauthorized access to, alteration of, or deletion,
            destruction, damage, loss or failure to store any of your Your Data. Our and our
            affiliates’ and licensors’ aggregate liability under this agreement will be limited to
            the amount you actually pay us under this agreement for the Services that gave rise to
            the claim during the 12 months preceding the claim.
          </p>
          <h2>Fees, Payment and Taxes</h2>
          <p>
            We charge and bill you for Services as described by the plan(s) selected within your
            account along with calculated overage amounts on a monthly basis. You authorize a
            recurring monthly charge to your credit card which you provide on the website for
            payment of Services that you have subscribed for automatically on a recurring basis. All
            amounts payable will be made without setoff or deduction, and all amounts paid are
            non-refundable. We may increase or add new fees and charge for Services by updating our
            subscription plans found on our website. In the event that we change the pricing for the
            plans you have subscribed to, the fees payable by you will increase or decrease in
            accordance with any such modification for the following subscription period.
          </p>

          <p>
            All fees and charges payable by you are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties,
            including VAT and applicable sales tax. You will provide us any information we
            reasonably request to determine whether we are obligated to collect VAT from you,
            including your VAT identification number. If you are legally entitled to an exemption
            from any sales, use, or similar transaction tax, you are responsible for providing us
            with legally-sufficient tax exemption certificates for each taxing jurisdiction. We will
            apply the tax exemption certificates to charges under your account occurring after the
            date we receive the tax exemption certificates. If any deduction or withholding is
            required by law, you will notify us and will pay us any additional amounts necessary to
            ensure that the net amount that we receive, after any deduction and withholding, equals
            the amount we would have received if no deduction or withholding had been required.
            Additionally, you will provide us with documentation showing that the withheld and
            deducted amounts have been paid to the relevant taxing authority.
          </p>

          <h2>Term and Termination</h2>
          <p>
            You may terminate this Agreement by terminating all Services under your account, and we
            may terminate this Agreement for any reason by providing you 30 days’ advance notice. We
            may also terminate your account and this Agreement, or suspend your access to the
            Services, immediately if: (i) we change the way we provide or discontinue any Service;
            (ii) you are late in payment or otherwise in breach of this Agreement; (iii) we
            reasonably determine that your use of the Services poses a risk to the availability,

            the Services may be unlawful; or (v) you have ceased to operate in the ordinary course,

            or become the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or
            similar proceeding. If we suspend your right to access or use any portion or all of the
            Services, you remain responsible for all fees and charges you have incurred during the
            suspension and you will not be entitled to any credit or refund. We will use
            commercially reasonable efforts to restore your access to the Services promptly
            following resolution of the cause of your suspension.
          </p>

          <p>

            terminate; and (ii) you remain responsible for all fees and charges you have incurred up
            to and including the date of termination. We have no obligation to continue hosting Your
            Data or any backup that you have terminated or after termination of this Agreement.
