            </p>
            <p>
              Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we
              advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one
              can guarantee absolute data security.
            </p>
            <p>

            <h4>How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</h4>
            <p>
              We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time period may
              depend on what we are using your information for, in accordance with this privacy
              policy. For example, if you have provided us with personal information as part of
              creating an account with us, we may retain this information for the duration your
              account exists on our system. If your personal information is no longer required for
              this purpose, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that
              identify you.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with
              a legal, accounting, or reporting obligation or for archiving purposes in the public
              interest, scientific, or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.
            </p>
            <h3>Telemetry</h3>
            <p>
              Payload CMS collects&nbsp;<strong>completely anonymous</strong>&nbsp;telemetry data
              about general usage. Participation in this is completely optional and can be opted out
              of.
            </p>
            <p>
              This data is super important to us and helps us accurately understand how we are
              growing and what we can do to build the software into everything that it can possibly
              be. The telemetry that we collect also help us demonstrate our growth in an accurate
              manner, which helps us as we seek investment to build and scale our team. If we can
              accurately demonstrate our growth, we can more effectively continue to support Payload
              as free and open-source software.
            </p>
            <h5>Specifically, we track the following information:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Payload version used</li>
              <li>Node version used</li>
              <li>NODE_ENV</li>
              <li>
                Environment IDs that help us understand how many active devs are working on Payload
                at a given time
              </li>
              <li>Anonymous user IDs that sign into the admin panel</li>
              <li>
                Generated project IDs that help us understand how many projects are currently built
                using Payload
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>
                All values are either completely anonymous or one-way hashed using your own secret
                key, which means that there is absolutely no way that Payload can use the telemetry
                data we collect to tie the data back to an individual or project. All data is
                entirely anonymous.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>

              The GDPR distinguishes between organizations that process personal information for

              European Economic Area (EEA) to countries outside the EEA will be protected by
              appropriate safeguards, for example by using standard data protection clauses approved

              <strong>Restrict:</strong>&nbsp;You have the right to request that we restrict the
              processing of your personal information if (i) you are concerned about the accuracy of
              your personal information; (ii) you believe your personal information has been

              <strong>Objecting to processing:</strong>&nbsp;You have the right to object to
              processing of your personal information that is based on our legitimate interests or
              public interest. If this is done, we must provide compelling legitimate grounds for
              the processing which overrides your interests, rights, and freedoms, in order to
              proceed with the processing of your personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Data portability:</strong>&nbsp;You may have the right to request a copy of

              the right to request that we transfer this personal information to a third party.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Deletion:</strong>&nbsp;You may have a right to request that we delete the
              personal information we hold about you at any time, and we will take reasonable steps
              to delete your personal information from our current records. If you ask us to delete
              your personal information, we will let you know how the deletion affects your use of
              our website or products and services. There may be exceptions to this right for
              specific legal reasons which, if applicable, we will set out for you in response to
              your request. Please be aware that search engines and similar third parties may still
              retain copies of your personal information that has been made public at least once,
              like certain profile information and public comments, even after you have deleted the
              information from our services or deactivated your account.
