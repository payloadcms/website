              <b>No Automated Decision-Making and Profiling</b>. As part of the Service, we do not

            <h5>Your rights</h5>
            <p>
              <b>General</b>. European data protection laws give you certain rights regarding your
              personal information. If you are located in Europe, you may ask us to take the

              <li>
                <b>Access</b>. Provide you with information about our processing of your personal
                information and give you access to your personal information.

              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Delete</b>. Delete your personal information where there is no lawful reason for
                us continuing to store or process it, where you have successfully exercised your
                right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your
                information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information
                to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply
                with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons that will be described to
                you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Portability</b>. Port a machine-readable copy of your personal information to you
                or a third party of your choice, in certain circumstances. Note that this right only
                applies to automated information for which you initially provided consent for us to
                use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Restrict</b>. Restrict the processing of your personal information, if, (i) you
                want us to establish the personal information's accuracy; (ii) where our use of the
                personal information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (iii) where you
                need us to hold the personal information even if we no longer require it as you need
                it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our
                use of your personal information but we need to verify whether we have overriding
                legitimate grounds to use it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Object</b>. Object to our processing of your personal information where we are
                relying on Legitimate Interests (or those of a third party) and there is something
                about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this
                ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedom – you also have
                the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct
                marketing purposes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Withdraw Consent</b>. When we use your personal information based on your
                consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This will not
                affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
                consent.

              information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request.
              Whether or not we are required to fulfill any request you make will depend on a number
              of factors (e.g., why and how we are processing your personal information), if we
              reject any request you may make (whether in whole or in part) we will let you know our
              grounds for doing so at the time, subject to any legal restrictions.

            <h5>Data Processing outside Europe</h5>
            <p>
              We are a U.S.-based company and many of our service providers, advisers, partners or
              other recipients of data are also based in the U.S. This means that, if you use the
              Service, your personal information will necessarily be accessed and processed in the
              U.S. It may also be provided to recipients in other countries outside Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is important to note that that the U.S. is not the subject of an ‘adequacy
              decision’ under the GDPR – basically, this means that the U.S. legal regime is not
              considered by relevant European bodies to provide an adequate level of protection for
              personal information, which is equivalent to that provided by relevant European laws.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where we share your personal information with third parties who are based outside
              Europe, we try to ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by making
              sure one of the following mechanisms is implemented:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Transfers to territories with an adequacy decision</b>. We may transfer your
                personal information to countries or territories whose laws have been deemed to
                provide an adequate level of protection for personal information by the European
                Commission or UK Government (as and where applicable) (from time to time).
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Transfers to territories without an adequacy decision</b>.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    We may transfer your personal information to countries or territories whose laws
                    have <b>not</b> been deemed to provide such an adequate level of protection
                    (e.g., the U.S., see above).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    However, in these cases:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        we may use specific appropriate safeguards, which are designed to give
                        personal information effectively the same protection it has in Europe – for
                        example, standard-form contracts approved by relevant authorize for this
                        purpose; or
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        in limited circumstances, we may rely on an exception, or ‘derogation’,
                        which permits us to transfer your personal information to such country
                        despite the absence of an ‘adequacy decision’ or ‘appropriate safeguards’ –
                        for example, reliance on your explicit consent to that transfer.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You may contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by
              us when transferring your personal information out of Europe.
