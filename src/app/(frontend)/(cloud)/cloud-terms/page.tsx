                  If Payload determines it has a legal obligation to collect a Sales Tax from
                  Customer in connection with this Agreement, Payload shall collect such Sales Tax
                  in addition to the payments required under this Agreement. If payments for any

                  penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and Customer will indemnify
                  Payload for any liability or expense Payload may incur in connection with such
                  Sales Taxes. Customer agrees to make all payments of fees to Payload free and
                  clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding taxes. Any such taxes imposed
                  on payments of fees to Payload will be Customer’s sole responsibility, and
                  Customer will provide Payload with official receipts issued by the appropriate
                  taxing authority, or such other evidence as Payload may reasonably request, to
                  establish that such taxes have been paid.

                  <b>Termination</b>. This Agreement will automatically terminate in the event that
                  Customer cancels a Subscription and does not enter into another Subscription for a
                  period of 30 days. Payload may terminate this Agreement with Customer at any time,
                  with or without cause. Either party may terminate the Agreement by written notice
                  if Customer does not have an active Subscription. Either party may terminate this
                  Agreement if the other party is in material breach of the Agreement, where such
                  material breach is not cured within 30 days after written notice of such breach
                  (provided that, in the event of Customer’s notice of breach with respect to this
                  Agreement and the services provided hereunder, such notice must: (i) be
                  sufficiently detailed for Payload to verify and remedy the issue; and (ii)
                  expressly state the intent to terminate). Either party may terminate this
                  Agreement if: (a) Customer ceases to carry on its business; (b) a receiver or
                  similar officer is appointed for Customer’s business, property, affairs or
                  revenues and such proceedings continue for 45 days; (c) Customer becomes
                  insolvent, admits in writing its inability to pay debts generally as they come
                  due, is adjudicated bankrupt, or enters composition proceedings, makes an
                  assignment for the benefit of its creditors or another arrangement of similar
                  import; or (d) proceedings under bankruptcy or insolvency laws are commenced by or
                  against Customer and are not dismissed within 45 days. For the avoidance of doubt,
                  Customer’s noncompliance with Section 1.3 & 4 shall be deemed a material breach of
                  the Agreement. With respect to Customer’s breach of its payment obligations, or
                  any license or use restrictions, electronic notice to Customer to the contact
                  information provided to Payload is sufficient hereunder. This provision is without
                  prejudice to any additional rights of termination afforded to either party
                  pursuant to applicable law.

                  related to the Service, SDK and API include only those rights customarily provided

                  are acceptable terms for granting those rights, and a mutually acceptable written
                  addendum specifically granting those rights must be included in any applicable
                  agreement.
