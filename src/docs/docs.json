It's meant to provide a massive boost to your\ndevelopment process, but importantly, stay out of your way as your apps get more complex.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Payload 2.0 has been released!</strong>\n  <br />\n  Includes Postgres support, Live Preview, Lexical Editor, and more. <a href=\"/blog/payload-2-0\">Read the announcement</a>.\n</Banner>\n\nOut of the box, Payload gives you a lot of the things that you often need when developing a new website, web app, or native app:\n\n- A database to store your data (Postgres and MongoDB supported)\n- A way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data of any shape via full REST and GraphQL APIs\n- Authentication—complete with commonly required functionality like registration, email verification, login, & password reset\n- Deep access control to your data, based on document or field-level functions\n- File storage and access control\n- A beautiful admin UI that's generated specifically to suit your data\n\n## What does \"headless\" mean?\n\nA headless CMS is a system that sticks to what it's good at—managing content. It concentrates solely on granting administrators an effective way to author and maintain content, but doesn't control how and where that content is used.\n\nIn this way, the CMS can ensure that its content editing experience is highly polished and effective while avoiding placing creative constraints on designers or restricting development teams. In contrast, traditional content management systems bind the presentation of your content to the storage of your content and severely limit the creativity, development and usability of the content that they manage.\n\nAt this point this concept is [widely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system) [discussed](https://css-tricks.com/what-is-a-headless-cms/) online, and for good reason. The web has become more complicated and with complexity comes the demand for developers to better structure their code. The rise of interface libraries like React and Vue are now the de-facto standard for building modern applications and traditional content management systems are often not designed to make use of them.\n\n### Why Payload?\n\nThe team behind Payload has been building websites and apps with existing content management systems and application frameworks for over a decade. We know what works and what doesn't about each of the existing solutions, and to this day have found no silver bullet solution.\n\n**We believe that a CMS should be:**\n\n- Cost-effective and should save time and effort\n- Intuitive for developers and content authors alike\n- Self-hosted however and wherever the application specifies\n- Designed in code but used with no coding experience\n- Blazing fast\n- Secure\n- Fully flexible and extensible\n\nPayload is our silver bullet solution. We've blended the best parts of our experience with other CMS and app frameworks into Payload, and we finally have everything we need when we build new apps and websites:\n\n- A beautiful, dynamic, customizable admin UI\n- Extensible and reusable authentication\n- Content localization\n- Local file storage\n- Extremely flexible access control\n- Field conditional logic\n- Block-based layout building\n- Array field type(s)\n- Security\n- and much more\n",

        "content": "\nPayload is based around a small and intuitive set of concepts. Before starting to work with Payload, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the following:\n\n### Config\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">The Payload config is where you configure everything that Payload does.</Banner>\n\nBy default, the Payload config lives in the root folder of your code and is named `payload.config.js` (`payload.config.ts` if you're using TypeScript), but you can customize its name and where you store it. You can write full functions and even full React components right into your config.\n\n### Collections\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  A Collection represents a type of content that Payload will store and can contain many documents.\n</Banner>\n\nCollections define the shape of your data as well as all functionalities attached to that data. They will contain one or many \"documents\", all corresponding with the same fields and functionalities that you define.\n\nThey can represent anything you can store in a database - for example - pages, posts, users, people, orders, categories, events, customers, transactions, and anything else your app needs.\n\n### Globals\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  A Global is a \"one-off\" piece of content that is perfect for storing navigational structures,\n  themes, top-level meta data, and more.\n</Banner>\n\nGlobals are in many ways similar to Collections, but there is only ever **one** instance of a Global, whereas Collections can contain many documents.\n\n### Fields\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  Fields are the building blocks of Payload. Collections and Globals both use Fields to define the\n  shape of the data that they store.\n</Banner>\n\nPayload comes with [many different field types](../fields/overview) that give you a ton of flexibility while designing your API. Each Field type has its own potential properties that allow you to customize how they work.\n\n### Hooks\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  Hooks are where you can \"tie in\" to existing Payload actions to perform your own additional logic\n  or modify how Payload operates altogether.\n</Banner>\n\nHooks are an extremely powerful concept and are central to extending and customizing your app. Payload provides a wide variety of hooks which you can utilize. For example, imagine if you'd like to send an email every time a document is created in your Orders collection. To do so, you can add an `afterChange` hook function to your Orders collection that receives the Order data and allows you to send an email accordingly.\n\nThere are many more potential reasons to use Hooks. For more, visit the [Hooks documentation](../hooks/overview).\n\n### Access Control\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  Access Control refers to Payload's system of defining who can do what to your API.\n</Banner>\n\nAccess Control is extremely powerful but easy and intuitive to manage. You can easily define your own full-blown RBAC (role-based access control) or any other access control pattern that your scenario requires. No conventions or structure is forced on you whatsoever.\n\nFor more, visit the [Access Control documentation](../access-control/overview).\n\n### Depth\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  \"Depth\" gives you control over how many levels down related documents should be automatically\n  populated when retrieved.\n</Banner>\n\nYou can specify population `depth` via query parameter in the REST API and by an option in the local API. _Depth has no effect in the GraphQL API, because there, depth is based on the shape of your queries._\nIt is also possible to limit the depth for specific `relation` and `upload` fields using the `maxDepth` property in your configuration.\n**For example, let's look at the following Collections:** `departments`, `users`, `posts`\n\n```\n// type: 'relationship' fields are equal to 1 depth level\n\n{\n\tslug: 'posts',\n\tfields: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'title',\n\t\t\ttype: 'text',\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'author',\n\t\t\tlabel: 'Post Author',\n\t\t\ttype: 'relationship',\n\t\t\trelationTo: 'users',\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n\n{\n\tslug: 'users',\n\tfields: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'email',\n\t\t\ttype: 'email',\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'department'\n\t\t\ttype: 'relationship',\n\t\t\trelationTo: 'departments'\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n\n{\n\tslug: 'departments',\n\tfields: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: 'name'\n\t\t\ttype: 'text',\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\n\nIf you were to query the Posts endpoint at, say, `http://localhost:3000/api/posts?depth=1`, you will retrieve Posts with populations one level deep. This depth parameter can be thought of as N, where N is the number of levels you want to populate. To populate one level further, you would simply specify N+1 as the depth. A returned result may look like the following:\n\n```\n// ?depth=1\n\n{\n  id: '5ae8f9bde69e394e717c8832',\n  title: 'This post sucks',\n  author: {\n    id: '5f7dd05cd50d4005f8bcab17',\n    email: 'spiderman@superheroes.gov',\n    department: '5e3ca05cd50d4005f8bdab15'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNotice how the `user.author` is fully populated, but `user.author.department` is left as a document ID? That's because the User collection counted as the first level of `depth` and got populated—but then prevented any further populations from taking place.\n\nTo populate `user.author.department` in it's entirety you could specify `?depth=2` or _higher_.\n\n```\n// ?depth=2\n\n{\n  id: '5ae8f9bde69e394e717c8832',\n  title: 'This post sucks',\n  author: {\n    id: '5f7dd05cd50d4005f8bcab17',\n    email: 'spiderman@superheroes.gov',\n    department: {\n      id: '5e3ca05cd50d4005f8bdab15',\n      name: 'Marvel'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  When access control on collections prevents relationship fields from populating, the API response\n  will contain the relationship id instead of the full document.\n</Banner>\n",

To do so, run the following command:\n\n```\nnpx create-payload-app@latest\n```\n\nThen just follow the prompts! You'll get set up with a new folder and a functioning Payload app inside.\n\n## Adding to an existing app\n\nAdding Payload to either a new or existing TypeScript + Express app is super straightforward. To add to an existing app, just run `npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps payload`.\n\nFrom there, the first step is writing a baseline config. Create a new `payload.config.ts` in your project's `/src` directory (or whatever your root TS dir is). The simplest config contains the following:\n\n```js\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  // By default, Payload will boot up normally\n  // and you will be provided with a base `User` collection.\n  // But, here is where you define how you'd like Payload to work!\n})\n```\n\nWrite the above code into your newly created config file. This baseline config will automatically provide you with a default `User` collection. For more information about users and authentication, including how to provide your own user config, jump to the [Authentication](../authentication/config) section.\n\nAlthough this is just the bare minimum config, there are _many_ more options that you can control here. To reference the full config and all of its options, [click here](../configuration/overview).\n\n### Server\n\nNow that you've got a baseline Payload config, it's time to initialize Payload. It requires an Express server that you provide, so if you're not familiar with how to set up a baseline Express server, please read up on exactly what Express is and why to use it. Express' own [Documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html) is a good place to start. Otherwise, follow along below for how to build your own Express server to use with Payload.\n\n1. Run `npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps express` if you have not done so already\n1. Create a new `server.ts` file in the root directory of your app\n1. Add the following code to `server.ts`:\n\n```ts\nimport express from 'express'\n\nconst app = express()\n\napp.listen(3000, async () => {\n  console.log(\n    \"Express is now listening for incoming connections on port 3000.\"\n  )\n})\n```\n\nThis server doesn't do anything just yet. But, after you have this in place, we can initialize Payload via its asynchronous `init()` method, which accepts a small set of arguments to tell it how to operate.\n\nTo initialize Payload, update your `server.ts` file to reflect the following code:\n\n```ts\nimport express from 'express'\nimport payload from 'payload'\n\nrequire('dotenv').config()\nconst app = express()\n\nconst start = async () => {\n  await payload.init({\n    secret: process.env.PAYLOAD_SECRET,\n    express: app,\n  })\n\n  app.listen(3000, async () => {\n    console.log(\n      \"Express is now listening for incoming connections on port 3000.\"\n    )\n  })\n}\n\nstart()\n```\n\nA quick reminder: in this configuration, we're making use of environmental variables, `process.env.PAYLOAD_SECRET`. Often, it's smart to store these values in an `.env` file at the root of your directory and set different values for each of your environments (local, stage, prod, etc). The `dotenv` package is very handy and works well alongside of Payload. A typical `.env` file will look like this:\n\n```\nDATABASE_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1/your-payload-app\nPAYLOAD_SECRET=your-payload-secret\n```\n\nHere is a list of all properties available to pass through `payload.init`:\n\n##### secret\n**Required**. This is a secure string that will be used to authenticate with Payload. It can be random but should be at least 14 characters and be very difficult to guess.\n\nPayload uses this secret key to generate secure user tokens (JWT). Behind the scenes, we do not use your secret key to encrypt directly - instead, we first take the secret key and create an encrypted string using the SHA-256 hash function. Then, we reduce the encrypted string to its first 32 characters. This final value is what Payload uses for encryption.\n\n##### config\n\nAllows you to pass your config directly to the onInit function. The config passed here should match the payload.config file.\n\n##### disableOnInit\n\nA boolean that disables running your `onInit` function when Payload starts up.\n\n##### disableDBConnect\n\nA boolean that disables the database connection when Payload starts up.\n\n##### email\n\nAn object used to configure SMTP. [Read more](../email/overview).\n\n##### express\nThis is your Express app as shown above. Payload will tie into your existing `app` and scope all of its functionalities to sub-routers. By default, Payload will add an `/admin` router and an `/api` router, but you can customize these paths.\n\n##### local\n\nA boolean that when set to `true` tells Payload to start in local-only mode which will bypass setting up API routes. When set to `true`, `express` is not required. This is useful when running scripts that need to use Payload's [local-api](../local-api/overview).\n\n##### loggerDestination\n\nSpecify destination stream for the built-in Pino logger that Payload uses for internal logging. See [Pino Docs](https://getpino.io/#/docs/api?id=pino-destination) for more info on what is available.\n\n##### loggerOptions\n\nSpecify options for the built-in Pino logger that Payload uses for internal logging. See [Pino Docs](https://getpino.io/#/docs/api?id=options) for more info on what is available.\n\n##### onInit\n\nA function that is called immediately following startup that receives the Payload instance as it's only argument.\n\n### Test it out\n\nAfter you've gotten this far, it's time to boot up Payload. Start your project in your application's folder to get going.\n\nAfter it starts, you can go to `http://localhost:3000/admin` to create your first Payload user!\n\n### Docker\n\nLooking to deploy Payload with Docker? New projects with `create-payload-app` come with a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file ready to go. Examples of these files can be seen in our [Deployment docs](../production/deployment#docker).\n",

All that's necessary to do is to require the package as high up in your application as possible (for example, at the top of your `server.js` file), and ensure that it can find an `.env` file that you create.\n\n**Add this line to the top of your server:**\n\n```\nrequire('dotenv').config()\n// ...\n// the rest of your `server.js` file goes here\n```\n\nNote that if you rely on any environment variables in your config itself, you should also call `dotenv()` at the top of your config itself as well. There's no harm in calling it in both your server and your config itself!\n\n**Here is an example project structure w/ `dotenv` and an `.env` file:**\n\n```\nproject-name\n---- .env\n---- package.json\n---- payload.config.js\n---- server.js\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If you use an environment variable to configure any properties that are required for the Admin\n  panel to function (ex. serverURL or any routes), you need to make sure that your Admin panel code\n  can access it. [Click here](../admin/webpack#admin-environment-vars) for more info.\n</Banner>\n\n### Customizing & Automating Config Location Detection\n\nPayload is designed to automatically locate your configuration file. By default, it will first look in the root of your current working directory for a file named `payload.config.js` or `payload.config.ts` if you're using TypeScript.\n\nIn development mode, if the configuration file is not found at the root, Payload will attempt to read your `tsconfig.json`, and search in the directory specified in `compilerOptions.rootDir` (typically \"src\").\n\nIn production mode, Payload will first attempt to find the config file in the output directory specified in `compilerOptions.outDir` of your `tsconfig.json`, then fallback to the source directory (`compilerOptions.rootDir`), and finally will check the 'dist' directory.\n\nPlease ensure your `tsconfig.json` is properly configured if you want Payload to accurately auto-detect your configuration file location. If `tsconfig.json` does not exist or doesn't specify `rootDir` or `outDir`, Payload will default to the current working directory.\n\n#### Overriding the Config Location\n\nIn addition to the above automated detection, you can specify your own location for the Payload config file. This is done by using the environment variable `PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH`. The path you provide via this environment variable can either be absolute or relative to your current working directory. This can be useful in situations where your Payload config is not in a standard location, or you wish to switch between multiple configurations.\n\n**Example in package.json:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH=path/to/custom-config.js node server.js\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen `PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH` is set, Payload will use this path to load the configuration, bypassing all automated detection.\n\n### Developing within the Config\n\nPayload comes with `isomorphic-fetch` installed which means that even in Node, you can use the `fetch` API just as you would within the browser. No need to import `axios` or similar, unless you want to!\n\n### TypeScript\n\nYou can import config types as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport { Config } from 'payload/config'\n\n// This is the type used for an incoming Payload config.\n// Only the bare minimum properties are marked as required.\n```\n\n```ts\nimport { SanitizedConfig } from 'payload/config'\n\n// This is the type used after an incoming Payload config is fully sanitized.\n// Generally, this is only used internally by Payload.\n```\n\n### Telemetry\n\nPayload collects **completely anonymous** telemetry data about general usage. This data is super important to us and helps us accurately understand how we're growing and what we can do to build the software into everything that it can possibly be. The telemetry that we collect also help us demonstrate our growth in an accurate manner, which helps us as we seek investment to build and scale our team. If we can accurately demonstrate our growth, we can more effectively continue to support Payload as free and open-source software. To opt out of telemetry, you can pass `telemetry: false` within your Payload config.\n\nFor more information about what we track, take a look at our [privacy policy](/privacy).\n",

The document being edited\n1. An `options` object, containing `locale` and `token` properties. The `token` is the currently logged-in user's JWT.\n\n**Example collection with preview function:**\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Posts: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'posts',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'slug',\n      type: 'text',\n      required: true,\n    },\n  ],\n  admin: {\n    preview: (doc, { locale }) => {\n      if (doc?.slug) {\n        return `https://bigbird.com/preview/posts/${doc.slug}?locale=${locale}`\n      }\n\n      return null\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Pagination\n\nHere are a few options that you can specify options for pagination on a collection-by-collection basis:\n\n| Option         | Description                                                                                         |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `defaultLimit` | Integer that specifies the default per-page limit that should be used. Defaults to 10.              |\n| `limits`       | Provide an array of integers to use as per-page options for admins to choose from in the List view. |\n\n### Access control\n\nYou can specify extremely granular access control (what users can do with documents in a collection) on a collection by\ncollection basis. To learn more, go to the [Access Control](../access-control/overview) docs.\n\n### Hooks\n\nHooks are a powerful way to extend collection functionality and execute your own logic, and can be defined on a\ncollection by collection basis. To learn more, go to the [Hooks](../hooks/overview) documentation.\n\n### Field types\n\nCollections support all field types that Payload has to offer—including simple fields like text and checkboxes all the\nway to more complicated layout-building field groups like Blocks. [Click here](../fields/overview) to learn more\nabout field types.\n\n### List Searchable Fields\n\nIn the List view, there is a \"search\" box that allows you to quickly find a document with a search. By default, it\nsearches on the ID field. If you have `admin.useAsTitle` defined, the list search will use that field. However, you can\ndefine more than one field to search to make it easier on your admin editors to find the data they need.\n\nFor example, let's say you have a Posts collection with `title`, `metaDescription`, and `tags` fields - and you want all\nthree of those fields to be searchable in the List view. You can simply\nadd `admin.listSearchableFields: ['title', 'metaDescription', 'tags']` - and the admin UI will automatically search on\nthose three fields plus the ID field.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If you are adding <strong>listSearchableFields</strong>, make sure you index each of these fields\n  so your admin queries can remain performant.\n</Banner>\n\n### Admin Hooks\n\nIn addition to collection hooks themselves, Payload provides for admin UI-specific hooks that you can leverage.\n\n**`beforeDuplicate`**\n\nThe `beforeDuplicate` hook is an async function that accepts an object containing the data to duplicate, as well as the\nlocale of the doc to duplicate. Within this hook, you can modify the data to be duplicated, which is useful in cases\nwhere you have unique fields that need to be incremented or similar, as well as if you want to automatically modify a\ndocument's `title`.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { BeforeDuplicate, CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n// Your auto-generated Page type\nimport { Page } from '../payload-types.ts'\n\nconst beforeDuplicate: BeforeDuplicate<Page> = ({ data }) => {\n  return {\n    ...data,\n    title: `${data.title} Copy`,\n    uniqueField: data.uniqueField ? `${data.uniqueField}-copy` : '',\n  }\n}\n\nexport const Page: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'pages',\n  admin: {\n    hooks: {\n      beforeDuplicate,\n    },\n  },\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'title',\n      type: 'text',\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'uniqueField',\n      type: 'text',\n      unique: true,\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n### TypeScript\n\nYou can import collection types as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\n// This is the type used for incoming collection configs.\n// Only the bare minimum properties are marked as required.\n```\n\n```ts\nimport { SanitizedCollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\n// This is the type used after an incoming collection config is fully sanitized.\n// Generally, this is only used internally by Payload.\n```\n",

        "content": "\nNot only does Payload support managing localized content, it also has internationalization support so that admin users can work in their preferred language. Payload's i18n support is built on top of [i18next](https://www.i18next.com). It comes included by default and can be extended in your config.\n\nWhile Payload's built-in features come translated, you may want to also translate parts of your project's configuration too. This is possible in places like collections and globals labels and groups, field labels, descriptions and input placeholder text. The admin UI will display all the correct translations you provide based on the user's language.\n\nHere is an example of a simple collection supporting both English and Spanish editors:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Articles: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'articles',\n  labels: {\n    singular: {\n      en: 'Article',\n      es: 'Artículo',\n    },\n    plural: {\n      en: 'Articles',\n      es: 'Artículos',\n    },\n  },\n  admin: {\n    group: { en: 'Content', es: 'Contenido' },\n  },\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'title',\n      type: 'text',\n      label: {\n        en: 'Title',\n        es: 'Título',\n      },\n      admin: {\n        placeholder: { en: 'Enter title', es: 'Introduce el título' },\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'type',\n      type: 'radio',\n      options: [\n        {\n          value: 'news',\n          label: { en: 'News', es: 'Noticias' },\n        }, // etc...\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n### Admin UI\n\nThe Payload admin panel reads the language settings of a user's browser and display all text in that language, or will fall back to English if the user's language is not yet supported.\nAfter a user logs in, they can change their language selection in the `/account` view.\n\n<Banner>\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If there is a language that Payload does not yet support, we accept code\n  [contributions](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n</Banner>\n\n### Node Express\n\nPayload's backend uses express middleware to set the language on incoming requests before they are handled. This allows backend validation to return error messages in the user's own language or system generated emails to be sent using the correct translation. You can make HTTP requests with the `accept-language` header and Payload will use that language.\n\nAnywhere in your Payload app that you have access to the `req` object, you can access i18next's extensive internationalization features assigned to `req.i18n`. To access text translations you can use `req.t('namespace:key')`.\n\nRead the i18next [API documentation](https://www.i18next.com/overview/api) to learn more.\n\n### Configuration Options\n\nIn your Payload config, you can add translations and customize the settings in `i18n`. Payload will use your custom options and merge it with the default, allowing you to override the settings Payload provides.\n\n**Example Payload config extending i18n:**\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  //...\n  i18n: {\n    fallbackLng: 'en', // default\n    debug: false, // default\n    resources: {\n      en: {\n        custom: {\n          // namespace can be anything you want\n          key1: 'Translation with {{variable}}', // translation\n        },\n        // override existing translation keys\n        general: {\n          dashboard: 'Home',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  //...\n})\n```\n\nSee the i18next [configuration options](https://www.i18next.com/overview/configuration-options) to learn more.\n",

To do so, follow the two steps below.\n\n### Enabling in the Payload config\n\nAdd the `localization` property to your Payload config to enable localization project-wide. You'll need to provide a\nlist of all locales that you'd like to support as well as set a few other options.\n\n**Example Payload config set up for localization:**\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    // collections go here\n  ],\n  localization: {\n    locales: ['en', 'es', 'de'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en',\n    fallback: true,\n  },\n})\n```\n\n**Example Payload config set up for localization with full locales objects:**\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    // collections go here\n  ],\n  localization: {\n    locales: [\n      {\n        label: 'English',\n        code: 'en',\n      },\n      {\n        label: 'Arabic',\n        code: 'ar',\n        // opt-in to setting default text-alignment on Input fields to rtl (right-to-left)\n        // when current locale is rtl\n        rtl: true,\n      },\n    ],\n    defaultLocale: 'en',\n    fallback: true,\n  },\n})\n```\n\n**Example Payload config set up for localization with full locales objects (\nincluding [internationalization](../configuration/i18n) support):**\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    // collections go here\n  ],\n  localization: {\n    locales: [\n      {\n        label: {\n          en: 'English', // English label\n          nb: 'Engelsk', // Norwegian label\n        },\n        code: 'en',\n      },\n      {\n        label: {\n          en: 'Norwegian', // English label\n          nb: 'Norsk', // Norwegian label\n        },\n        code: 'nb',\n      },\n    ],\n    defaultLocale: 'en',\n    fallback: true,\n  },\n})\n```\n\n**Here is a brief explanation of each of the options available within the `localization` property:**\n\n**`locales`**\n\nArray-based list of all the languages that you would like to support. This can be an array containing strings for each\nlanguage code you want your project to store and serve or objects with a `label`, a locale `code`, `rtl` (\nright-to-left), and `fallbackLocale` property. The locale codes do not need to be in any specific format. It's up to you\nto define how to represent your locales. Common patterns are to use two-letter ISO 639 language codes or four-letter\nlanguage and country codes (ISO 3166‑1) such as `en-US`, `en-UK`, `es-MX`, etc.\n\n### Locale Properties:\n\n| Option               | Description                                                                                                                    |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **`code`** \\*        | Unique code to identify the language throughout the APIs for `locale` and `fallbackLocale`                                     |\n| **`label`**          | A string to use for the selector when choosing a language, or an object keyed on the i18n keys for different languages in use. |\n| **`rtl`**            | A boolean that when true will make the admin UI display in Right-To-Left.                                                      |\n| **`fallbackLocale`** | The code for this language to fallback to when properties of a document are not present.                                       |\n\n_\\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._\n\n**`defaultLocale`**\n\nRequired string that matches one of the locale codes from the array provided. By default, if no locale is specified,\ndocuments will be returned in this locale.\n\n**`fallback`**\n\nBoolean enabling \"fallback\" locale functionality. If a document is requested in a locale, but a field does not have a\nlocalized value corresponding to the requested locale, then if this property is enabled, the document will automatically\nfall back to the fallback locale value. If this property is not enabled, the value will not be populated.\n\n### Field by field localization\n\nPayload localization works on a **field** level—not a document level. In addition to configuring the base Payload config\nto support localization, you need to specify each field that you would like to localize.\n\n**Here is an example of how to enable localization for a field:**\n\n```js\n{\n  name: 'title',\n  type: 'text',\n  // highlight-start\n  localized: true,\n  // highlight-end\n}\n```\n\nWith the above configuration, the `title` field will now be saved in the database as an object of all locales instead of\na single string.\n\nAll field types with a `name` property support the `localized` property—even the more complex field types like `array`s\nand `block`s.\n\n<Banner>\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  Enabling localization for field types that support nested fields will automatically create\n  localized \"sets\" of all fields contained within the field. For example, if you have a page layout\n  using a blocks field type, you have the choice of either localizing the full layout, by enabling\n  localization on the top-level blocks field, or only certain fields within the layout.\n</Banner>\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong>\n  <br />\n  When converting an existing field to or from `localized: true` the data structure in the document\n  will change for this field and so existing data for this field will be lost. Before changing the\n  localization setting on fields with existing data, you may need to consider a field migration\n  strategy.\n</Banner>\n\n### Retrieving localized docs\n\nWhen retrieving documents, you can specify which locale you'd like to receive as well as which fallback locale should be\nused.\n\n##### REST API\n\nREST API locale functionality relies on URL query parameters.\n\n**`?locale=`**\n\nSpecify your desired locale by providing the `locale` query parameter directly in the endpoint URL.\n\n**`?fallback-locale=`**\n\nSpecify fallback locale to be used by providing the `fallback-locale` query parameter. This can be provided as either a\nvalid locale as provided to your base Payload config, or `'null'`, `'false'`, or `'none'` to disable falling back.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nfetch('https://localhost:3000/api/pages?locale=es&fallback-locale=none');\n```\n\n##### GraphQL API\n\nIn the GraphQL API, you can specify `locale` and `fallbackLocale` args to all relevant queries and mutations.\n\nThe `locale` arg will only accept valid locales, but locales will be formatted automatically as valid GraphQL enum\nvalues (dashes or special characters will be converted to underscores, spaces will be removed, etc.). If you are curious\nto see how locales are auto-formatted, you can use the [GraphQL playground](../graphql/overview#graphql-playground).\n\nThe `fallbackLocale` arg will accept valid locales as well as `none` to disable falling back.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```graphql\nquery {\n    Posts(locale: de, fallbackLocale: none) {\n        docs {\n            title\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<Banner>\n  In GraphQL, specifying the locale at the top level of a query will automatically apply it\n  throughout all nested relationship fields. You can override this behavior by re-specifying locale\n  arguments in nested related document queries.\n</Banner>\n\n##### Local API\n\nYou can specify `locale` as well as `fallbackLocale` within the Local API as well as properties on the `options`\nargument. The `locale` property will accept any valid locale, and the `fallbackLocale` property will accept any valid\nlocale as well as `'null'`, `'false'`, `false`, and `'none'`.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```js\nconst posts = await payload.find({\n  collection: 'posts',\n  locale: 'es',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n})\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"alert\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  <br />\n  The REST and Local APIs can return all localization data in one request by passing 'all' or '*' as\n  the <strong>locale</strong> parameter. The response will be structured so that field values come\n  back as the full objects keyed for each locale instead of the single, translated value.\n</Banner>\n",

        "content": "\nPayload utilizes a few Express-specific middleware packages within its own routers. You can customize how they work by passing in configuration options to the main Payload config's `express` property.\n\n### Custom Middleware\n\nPayload allows you to pass in custom Express middleware to be used on all of the routes it opens. This is useful for adding logging or any other custom functionality to your endpoints.\n\nThere are 2 exposed properties. Each property is an array of middleware functions.\n\n- `preMiddleware` - runs before any of the Payload middleware\n- `postMiddleware` - runs after all of the Payload middleware\n\n```ts\n{\n  express: {\n    preMiddleware: [\n      (req, res, next) => {\n        // do something\n        next()\n      }\n    ],\n    postMiddleware: [\n      (req, res, next) => {\n        // do something\n        next()\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n// Example logging middleware function\nconst requestLoggerMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {\n  req.payload.logger.info(`request: ${req.method} ${req.url}`)\n  next()\n}\n```\n\n### JSON\n\n`express.json()` is used to parse JSON body content into JavaScript objects accessible on the Express `req`. Payload allows you to customize all of the `json` method's options. Common examples of customization use-cases are increasing the max allowed JSON body size which defaults to `2MB`.\n\n**Example payload.config.js for how to increase the max JSON size allowed to be sent to Payload endpoints:**\n\n```js\n{\n\texpress: {\n\t\tjson: {\n\t\t\tlimit: '4mb',\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nYou can find a list of all available options that are able to be passed to `express.json()` [here](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html).\n\n### Compression\n\nPayload uses the `compression` package to optimize transfer size for all of the routes it opens, and you can pass customization options through the Payload config.\n\nTo customize compression options, pass an object to the Payload config's `express` property.\n\n**Example payload.config.js:**\n\n```js\n{\n  express: {\n    compression: {\n      // settings go here\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTypically, the default options for this package are suitable. However, for a list of all available customization options, [click here](http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/compression.html).\n",

        "content": "\nPayload interacts with your database via the database adapter that you choose. Right now, Payload officially supports two database adapters:\n\n1. [MongoDB](../database/mongodb) w/ [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)\n1. [Postgres](../database/postgres) w/ [Drizzle](https://drizzle.team/)\n\nWe will be adding support for SQLite and MySQL in the near future using Drizzle ORM.\n\nTo use a specific database adapter, you need to install it and configure it according to its own specifications. Visit the documentation for your applicable database adapter to learn more.\n\n## Selecting a database\n\nThere are several factors to consider when choosing which database technology and hosting option is right for your project and workload. Payload can theoretically support any database, but it's up to you to decide which database to use.\n\n#### When to use MongoDB\n\nIf your project has a lot of dynamic fields, and you are comfortable with allowing Payload to enforce data integrity across your documents, MongoDB is a great choice. With it, your Payload documents are stored as _one_ document in your database—no matter if you have localization enabled, how many block or array fields you have, etc. This means that the shape of your data in your database will very closely reflect your field schema, and there is minimal complexity involved in storing or retrieving your data.\n\nYou should prefer MongoDB if:\n\n- You prefer simplicity within your database\n- You don't want to deal with keeping production / staging databases in sync via [DDL changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language)\n- Most (or everything) in your project is localized\n- You leverage a lot of array fields, block fields, or `hasMany` select fields and similar\n\n#### When to use a relational DB\n\nMany projects might call for more rigid database architecture where the shape of your data is strongly enforced at the database level. For example, if you know the shape of your data and it's relatively \"flat\", and you don't anticipate it to change often, your workload might suit relational databases like Postgres very well.\n\nYou should prefer a relational DB like Postgres if:\n\n- You are comfortable with migration workflows\n- You require enforced data consistency at the database level\n- You have a lot of relationships between collections and require relationships to be enforced\n\n#### Differences in Payload features\n\nIt's important to note that almost everything Payload does is available in all of our officially supported database adapters, including localization, arrays, blocks, etc. \n\nThe only thing that is not supported in Postgres yet is the [Point field](../fields/point), but that should be added soon. \n\nIt's up to you to choose which database you would like to use.\n\n## Configuration\n\nTo configure the database for your Payload application, an adapter can be assigned to `config.db`. This property is required within your Payload config. \n\nHere's an example:\n\n```ts\nimport { postgresAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-postgres'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  // Your config goes here\n  collections: [\n    // Collections go here\n  ],\n  // Here is where you pass your database adapter\n  // and the adapter will require options specific to itself\n  db: postgresAdapter({\n    pool: {\n      connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URI,\n    }\n  }),\n})\n```",

        "content": "\nPayload exposes a full suite of migration controls available for your use. Migration commands are accessible via\nthe `npm run payload` command in your project directory.\n\nEnsure you have an npm script called \"payload\" in your `package.json` file.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"payload\": \"cross-env PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH=src/payload.config.ts payload\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Banner>\n  Note that you need to run Payload migrations through the package manager that you are using, because Payload should not be globally installed on your system.\n</Banner>\n\n### Migration file contents\n\nPayload stores all created migrations in a folder that you can specify. By default, migrations are stored\nin `./src/migrations`.\n\nA migration file has two exports - an `up` function, which is called when a migration is executed, and a `down` function\nthat will be called if for some reason the migration fails to complete successfully. The `up` function should contain\nall changes that you attempt to make within the migration, and the `down` should ideally revert any changes you make.\n\nFor an added level of safety, migrations should leverage Payload [transactions](../database/transactions). Migration\nfunctions should make use of the `req` by adding it to the arguments of your payload local API calls such\nas `payload.create` and database adapter methods like `payload.db.create`.\n\nHere is an example migration file:\n\n```ts\nimport { MigrateUpArgs, MigrateDownArgs } from '@payloadcms/your-db-adapter'\n\nexport async function up ({ payload, req }: MigrateUpArgs): Promise<void> {\n  // Perform changes to your database here.\n  // You have access to `payload` as an argument, and\n  // everything is done in TypeScript.\n};\n\nexport async function down ({ payload, req }: MigrateDownArgs): Promise<void> {\n  // Do whatever you need to revert changes if the `up` function fails\n};\n```\n\n### Migrations Directory\n\nEach DB adapter has an optional property `migrationDir` where you can override where you want your migrations to be\nstored/read. If this is not specified, Payload will check the default and possibly make a best effort to find your\nmigrations directory by searching in common locations ie. `./src/migrations`, `./dist/migrations`, `./migrations`, etc.\n\nAll database adapters should implement similar migration patterns, but there will be small differences based on the\nadapter and its specific needs. Below is a list of all migration commands that should be supported by your database\nadapter.\n\n## Commands\n\n### Migrate\n\nThe `migrate` command will run any migrations that have not yet been run.\n\n```text\nnpm run payload migrate\n```\n\n### Create\n\nCreate a new migration file in the migrations directory. You can optionally name the migration that will be created. By\ndefault, migrations will be named using a timestamp.\n\n```text\nnpm run payload migrate:create optional-name-here\n```\n\n### Status\n\nThe `migrate:status` command will check the status of migrations and output a table of which migrations have been run,\nand which migrations have not yet run.\n\n`payload migrate:status`\n\n```text\nnpm run payload migrate:status\n```\n\n### Down\n\nRoll back the last batch of migrations.\n\n```text\nnpm run payload migrate:down\n```\n\n### Refresh\n\nRoll back all migrations that have been run, and run them again.\n\n```text\nnpm run payload migrate:refresh\n```\n\n### Reset\n\nRoll back all migrations.\n\n```text\nnpm run payload migrate:reset\n```\n\n### Fresh\n\nDrops all entities from the database and re-runs all migrations from scratch.\n\n```text\nnpm run payload migrate:fresh\n```\n",

        "content": "\nDatabase transactions allow your application to make a series of database changes in an all-or-nothing commit. Consider an HTTP request that creates a new **Order** and has an `afterChange` hook to update the stock count of related **Items**. If an error occurs when updating an **Item** and an HTTP error is returned to the user, you would not want the new **Order** to be persisted or any other items to be changed either. This kind of interaction with the database is handled seamlessly with transactions.\n\nBy default, Payload will use transactions for all operations, as long as it is supported by the configured database. Database changes are contained within all Payload operations and any errors thrown will result in all changes being rolled back without being committed. When transactions are not supported by the database, Payload will continue to operate as expected without them.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  MongoDB requires a connection to a replicaset in order to make use of transactions.\n</Banner>\n\nThe initial request made to Payload will begin a new transaction and attach it to the `req.transactionID`. If you have a `hook` that interacts with the database, you can opt-in to using the same transaction by passing the `req` in the arguments. For example:\n\n```ts\nconst afterChange: CollectionAfterChangeHook = async ({ req }) => {\n  // because req.transactionID is assigned from Payload and passed through,\n  // my-slug will only persist if the entire request is successful\n  await req.payload.create({\n    req,\n    collection: 'my-slug',\n    data: {\n      some: 'data',\n    },\n  })\n}\n```\n\n### Async Hooks with Transactions\n\nSince Payload hooks can be async and be written to not await the result, it is possible to have an incorrect success response returned on a request that is rolled back. If you have a hook where you do not `await` the result, then you should **not** pass the `req.transactionID`.\n\n```ts\nconst afterChange: CollectionAfterChangeHook = async ({ req }) => {\n  // WARNING: an async call made with the same req, but NOT awaited,\n  // may fail resulting in an OK response being returned with response data that is not committed\n  const dangerouslyIgnoreAsync = req.payload.create({\n    req,\n    collection: 'my-slug',\n    data: {\n      some: 'other data',\n    },\n  })\n\n  // Should this call fail, it will not rollback other changes\n  // because the req (and its transactionID) is not passed through\n  const safelyIgnoredAsync = req.payload.create({\n    collection: 'my-slug',\n    data: {\n      some: 'other data',\n    },\n  })\n}\n```\n\n### Direct Transaction Access\n\nWhen writing your own scripts or custom endpoints, you may wish to have direct control over transactions. This is useful for interacting with your database in something like a background job, outside the normal request-response flow.\n\nThe following functions can be used for managing transactions:\n\n`payload.db.beginTransaction` - Starts a new session and returns a transaction ID for use in other Payload Local API calls. Note that if your database does not support transactions, this will return `null`.\\\n`payload.db.commitTransaction` - Takes the identifier for the transaction, finalizes any changes.\\\n`payload.db.rollbackTransaction` - Takes the identifier for the transaction, discards any changes.\n\nYou can then use the transaction ID with Payload's local API by passing it inside the `PayloadRequest` object.\n\nHere is an example for a \"background job\" function, which utilizes the direct transaction API to make sure it either succeeds completely or gets rolled back in case of an error.\n\n```ts\nasync function allOrNothingJob() {\n    const req = {} as PayloadRequest;\n    req.transactionID = await payload.db.beginTransaction();\n    try {\n      await payload.create({\n        req, // use our manual transaction\n        collection: 'my-slug',\n        data: {\n          some: 'data'\n        }\n      });\n\n      await payload.create({\n        req, // use our manual transaction\n        collection: 'something-else',\n        data: {\n          some: 'data'\n        }\n      });\n      console.log('Everything done.');\n      if (req.transactionID) await payload.db.commitTransaction(req.transactionID);\n    } catch (e) {\n      console.error('Oh no, something went wrong!');\n      if (req.transactionID) await payload.db.rollbackTransaction(req.transactionID);\n    }\n\n}\n```\n",

This only works in development mode, and should not be mixed with manually running [`migrate`](../database/migrations) commands.\n\nYou will be warned if any changes that you make will entail data loss while in development mode. Push is enabled by default, but you can opt out if you'd like.\n\nAlternatively, you can disable `push` and rely solely on migrations to keep your local database in sync with your Payload config.\n\n### Migration workflows\n\nMigrations are extremely powerful thanks to the seamless way that Payload and Drizzle work together. Let's take the following scenario:\n\n1. You are building your Payload config locally, with a local database used for testing.\n1. You have left the default setting of `push` enabled, so every time you change your Payload config (add or remove fields, collections, etc.), Drizzle will automatically push changes to your local DB.\n1. Once you're done with your changes, or have completed a feature, you can run `npm run payload migrate:create`.\n1. Payload and Drizzle will look for any existing migrations, and automatically generate all SQL changes necessary to convert your schema from its prior state into the state of your current Payload config, and store the resulting DDL in a newly created migration.\n1. Once you're ready to go to production, you will be able to run `npm run payload migrate` against your production database, which will apply any new migrations that have not yet run.\n1. Now your production database is in sync with your Payload config!\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  Warning: do not mix \"push\" and migrations with your local development database. If you use \"push\" locally, and then try to migrate, Payload will throw a warning, telling you that these two methods are not meant to be used interchangeably.\n</Banner>\n",

For more information about field-level access control, [click here](../access-control/overview#fields).\n\n### Field names\n\nSome fields use their `name` property as a unique identifier to store and retrieve from the database. `__v`, `salt`, and `hash` are all reserved field names which are sanitized from Payload's config and cannot be used.\n\n### Validation\n\nField validation is enforced automatically based on the field type and other properties such as `required` or `min` and `max` value constraints on certain field types. This default behavior can be replaced by providing your own validate function for any field. It will be used on both the frontend and the backend, so it should not rely on any Node-specific packages. The validation function can be either synchronous or asynchronous and expects to return either `true` or a string error message to display in both API responses and within the Admin panel.\n\nThere are two arguments available to custom validation functions.\n\n1. The value which is currently assigned to the field\n2. An optional object with dynamic properties for more complex validation having the following:\n\n| Property      | Description                                                                                                              |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `data`        | An object of the full collection or global document.                                                                     |\n| `siblingData` | An object of the document data limited to fields within the same parent to the field.                                    |\n| `operation`   | Will be \"create\" or \"update\" depending on the UI action or API call.                                                     |\n| `id`          | The value of the collection `id`, will be `undefined` on create request.                                                 |\n| `t`           | The function for translating text, [more](../configuration/i18n).                                                     |\n| `user`        | The currently authenticated user object.                                                                                 |\n| `payload`     | If the `validate` function is being executed on the server, Payload will be exposed for easily running local operations. |\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Orders: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'orders',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'customerNumber',\n      type: 'text',\n      validate: async (val, { operation }) => {\n        if (operation !== 'create') {\n          // skip validation on update\n          return true\n        }\n        const response = await fetch(`https://your-api.com/customers/${val}`)\n        if (response.ok) {\n          return true\n        }\n\n        return 'The customer number provided does not match any customers within our records.'\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nWhen supplying a field `validate` function, Payload will use yours in place of the default. To make use of the default field validation in your custom logic you can import, call and return the result as needed.\n\nFor example:\n\n```ts\nimport { text } from 'payload/fields/validations'\n\nconst field: Field = {\n  name: 'notBad',\n  type: 'text',\n  validate: (val, args) => {\n    if (val === 'bad') {\n      return 'This cannot be \"bad\"'\n    }\n    // highlight-start\n    return text(val, args)\n    // highlight-end\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Customizable ID\n\nCollections ID fields are generated automatically by default. An explicit `id` field can be declared in the `fields` array to override this behavior.\nUsers are then required to provide a custom ID value when creating a record through the Admin UI or API.\nValid ID types are `number` and `text`.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\n{\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'id',\n      type: 'number',\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n### Admin config\n\nIn addition to each field's base configuration, you can define specific traits and properties for fields that only have effect on how they are rendered in the Admin panel. The following properties are available for all fields within the `admin` property:\n\n| Option              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `condition`         | You can programmatically show / hide fields based on what other fields are doing.

[Click here](#description) for more info.                                                                                                 |\n| `position`          | Specify if the field should be rendered in the sidebar by defining `position: 'sidebar'`.                                                                                                                                        |\n| `width`             | Restrict the width of a field. you can pass any string-based value here, be it pixels, percentages, etc. This property is especially useful when fields are nested within a `Row` type where they can be organized horizontally. |\n| `style`             | Attach raw CSS style properties to the root DOM element of a field.                                                                                                                                                              |\n| `className`         | Attach a CSS class name to the root DOM element of a field.                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| `readOnly`          | Setting a field to `readOnly` has no effect on the API whatsoever but disables the admin component's editability to prevent editors from modifying the field's value.                                                            |\n| `disabled`          | If a field is `disabled`, it is completely omitted from the Admin panel.                                                                                                                                                         |\n| `disableBulkEdit`   | Set `disableBulkEdit` to `true` to prevent fields from appearing in the select options when making edits for multiple documents.                                                                                                 |\n| `disableListColumn` | Set `disableListColumn` to `true` to prevent fields from appearing in the list view column selector.                                                                                                                             |\n| `disableListFilter` | Set `disableListFilter` to `true` to prevent fields from appearing in the list view filter options.                                                                                                                              |\n| `hidden`            | Setting a field's `hidden` property on its `admin` config will transform it into a `hidden` input type. Its value will still submit with the Admin panel's requests, but the field itself will not be visible to editors.        |\n\n### Custom components\n\nAll Payload fields support the ability to swap in your own React components with ease. For more information, including examples, [click here](../admin/components#fields).\n\n### Conditional logic\n\nYou can show and hide fields based on what other fields are doing by utilizing conditional logic on a field by field basis. The `condition` property on a field's admin config accepts a function which takes three arguments:\n\n- `data` - the entire document's data that is currently being edited\n- `siblingData` - only the fields that are direct siblings to the field with the condition\n- `{ user }` - the final argument is an object containing the currently authenticated user\n\nThe `condition` function should return a boolean that will control if the field should be displayed or not.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```ts\n{\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'enableGreeting',\n      type: 'checkbox',\n      defaultValue: false,\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'greeting',\n      type: 'text',\n      admin: {\n        // highlight-start\n        condition: (data, siblingData, { user }) => {\n          if (data.enableGreeting) {\n            return true\n          } else {\n            return false\n          }\n        },\n        // highlight-end\n      },\n    },\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Default values\n\nFields can be prefilled with starting values using the `defaultValue` property. This is used in the admin UI and also on the backend as API requests will be populated with missing or undefined field values. You can assign the defaultValue directly in the field configuration or supply a function for dynamic behavior. Values assigned during a create request on the server are added before validation occurs.\n\nFunctions are called with an optional argument object containing:\n\n- `user` - the authenticated user object\n- `locale` - the currently selected locale string\n\nHere is an example of a defaultValue function that uses both:\n\n```ts\nconst translation: {\n  en: 'Written by'\n  es: 'Escrito por'\n}\n\nconst field = {\n  name: 'attribution',\n  type: 'text',\n  // highlight-start\n  defaultValue: ({ user, locale }) => `${translation[locale]} ${user.name}`,\n  // highlight-end\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  You can use async defaultValue functions to fill fields with data from API requests.\n</Banner>\n\n### Description\n\nA description can be configured in three ways.\n\n- As a string\n- As a function which returns a string\n- As a React component\n\nFunctions are called with an optional argument object with the following shape, and React components are rendered with the following props:\n\n- `path` - the path of the field\n- `value` - the current value of the field\n\nAs shown above, you can simply provide a string that will show by the field, but there are use cases where you may want to create some dynamic feedback. By using a function or a component for the `description` property you can provide realtime feedback as the user interacts with the form.\n\n**Function Example:**\n\n```ts\n{\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'message',\n      type: 'text',\n      maxLength: 20,\n      admin: {\n        description: ({ path, value }) =>\n          `${typeof value === 'string' ? 20 - value.length : '20'} characters left (field: ${path})`,\n      },\n    },\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis example will display the number of characters allowed as the user types.\n\n**Component Example:**\n\n```ts\n{\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'message',\n      type: 'text',\n      maxLength: 20,\n      admin: {\n        description:\n          ({ path, value }) => (\n            <div>\n              Character count:\n              {' '}\n              { value?.length || 0 }\n               (field: {path})\n            </div>\n          )\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis component will count the number of characters entered, as well as display the path of the field.\n\n### TypeScript\n\nYou can import the internal Payload `Field` type as well as other common field types as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Field } from 'payload/types'\n```\n",

This way each block config can be easily shared between fields. For\n  instance, using the \"layout builder\" example, you might want to feature a few of the same blocks\n  in a Post collection as well as a Page collection. Abstracting into their own files trivializes\n  their reusability.\n</Banner>\n\n| Option                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **`slug`** \\*              | Identifier for this block type.

To do\nso, you can import and use Payload's `Block` type:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Block } from 'payload/types'\n```\n",

By providing a schema in your field config, the editor will be guided in the admin UI, getting typeahead for properties and their formats automatically. When the document is saved, the default validation will prevent saving any invalid data in the field according to the schema in your config.\n\nIf you only provide a URL to a schema, Payload will fetch the desired schema if it is publicly available. If not, it is recommended to add the schema directly to your config or import it from another file so that it can be implemented consistently in your project.\n\n\n#### Local JSON Schema\n\n`collections/ExampleCollection.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'customerJSON', // required\n      type: 'json', // required\n      jsonSchema: {\n        uri: 'a://b/foo.json', // required\n        fileMatch: ['a://b/foo.json'], // required\n        schema: {\n          type: 'object',\n          properties: {\n            foo: {\n              enum: ['bar', 'foobar'],\n            }\n          },\n        },\n      },\n\n    },\n  ],\n}\n// {\"foo\": \"bar\"} or {\"foo\": \"foobar\"} - ok\n// Attempting to create {\"foo\": \"not-bar\"} will throw an error\n```\n\n#### Remote JSON Schema\n\n`collections/ExampleCollection.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'customerJSON', // required\n      type: 'json', // required\n      jsonSchema: {\n        uri: 'https://example.com/customer.schema.json', // required\n        fileMatch: ['https://example.com/customer.schema.json'], // required\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n}\n// If 'https://example.com/customer.schema.json' has a JSON schema\n// {\"foo\": \"bar\"} or {\"foo\": \"foobar\"} - ok\n// Attempting to create {\"foo\": \"not-bar\"} will throw an error\n```\n",

The full date is always stored in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ` (e.g. `1999-01-01T8:00:00.000+05:00`).\n\n`displayFormat` determines how the date is presented in the field **cell**, you can pass any valid (unicode date format)[https://date-fns.org/v2.29.3/docs/format].\n\n`pickerAppearance` sets the appearance of the **react datepicker**, the options available are `dayAndTime`, `dayOnly`, `timeOnly`, and `monthOnly`. By default, the datepicker will display `dayOnly`.\n\nWhen only `pickerAppearance` is set, an equivalent format will be rendered in the date field cell. To overwrite this format, set `displayFormat`.\n\n### Example\n\n`collections/ExampleCollection.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'dateOnly',\n      type: 'date',\n      admin: {\n        date: {\n          pickerAppearance: 'dayOnly',\n          displayFormat: 'd MMM yyy',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'timeOnly',\n      type: 'date',\n      admin: {\n        date: {\n          pickerAppearance: 'timeOnly',\n          displayFormat: 'h:mm:ss a',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'monthOnly',\n      type: 'date',\n      admin: {\n        date: {\n          pickerAppearance: 'monthOnly',\n          displayFormat: 'MMMM yyyy',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n",

This can be particularly useful for ensuring that the most relevant options are presented first to the user.\n\nYou can specify `sortOptions` in two ways:\n\n**As a string:**\n\nProvide a string to define a global default sort field for all relationship field dropdowns across different\ncollections. You can prefix the field name with a minus symbol (\"-\") to sort in descending order.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nsortOptions: 'fieldName',\n```\n\nThis configuration will sort all relationship field dropdowns by `\"fieldName\"` in ascending order.\n\n**As an object :**\n\nSpecify an object where keys are collection slugs and values are strings representing the field names to sort by. This\nallows for different sorting fields for each collection's relationship dropdown.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nsortOptions: {\n  \"pages\"\n:\n  \"fieldName1\",\n    \"posts\"\n:\n  \"-fieldName2\",\n    \"categories\"\n:\n  \"fieldName3\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this configuration:\n\n- Dropdowns related to `pages` will be sorted by `\"fieldName1\"` in ascending order.\n- Dropdowns for `posts` will use `\"fieldName2\"` for sorting in descending order (noted by the \"-\" prefix).\n- Dropdowns associated with `categories` will sort based on `\"fieldName3\"` in ascending order.\n\nNote: If `sortOptions` is not defined, the default sorting behavior of the Relationship field dropdown will be used.\n\n### Filtering relationship options\n\nOptions can be dynamically limited by supplying a [query constraint](../queries/overview), which will be used both\nfor validating input and filtering available relationships in the UI.\n\nThe `filterOptions` property can either be a `Where` query, or a function returning `true` to not filter, `false` to\nprevent all, or a `Where` query. When using a function, it will be\ncalled with an argument object with the following properties:\n\n| Property      | Description                                                                          |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `relationTo`  | The `relationTo` to filter against (as defined on the field)                         |\n| `data`        | An object of the full collection or global document currently being edited           |\n| `siblingData` | An object of the document data limited to fields within the same parent to the field |\n| `id`          | The value of the collection `id`, will be `undefined` on create request              |\n| `user`        | The currently authenticated user object                                              |\n\n### Example\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'purchase',\n      type: 'relationship',\n      relationTo: ['products', 'services'],\n      filterOptions: ({ relationTo, siblingData }) => {\n        // returns a Where query dynamically by the type of relationship\n        if (relationTo === 'products') {\n          return {\n            stock: { greater_than: siblingData.quantity },\n          }\n        }\n\n        if (relationTo === 'services') {\n          return {\n            isAvailable: { equals: true },\n          }\n        }\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nYou can learn more about writing queries [here](../queries/overview).\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  When a relationship field has both <strong>filterOptions</strong> and a custom{' '}\n  <strong>validate</strong> function, the api will not validate <strong>filterOptions</strong>{' '}\n  unless you call the default relationship field validation function imported from{' '}\n  <strong>payload/fields/validations</strong> in your validate function.\n</Banner>\n\n### How the data is saved\n\nGiven the variety of options possible within the `relationship` field type, the shape of the data needed for creating\nand updating these fields can vary. The following sections will describe the variety of data shapes that can arise from\nthis field.\n\n#### Has One\n\nThe most simple pattern of a relationship is to use `hasMany: false` with a `relationTo` that allows for only one type\nof collection.\n\n```ts\n{\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n    fields\n:\n  [\n    {\n      name: 'owner', // required\n      type: 'relationship', // required\n      relationTo: 'users', // required\n      hasMany: false,\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe shape of the data to save for a document with the field configured this way would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  // ObjectID of the related user\n  \"owner\": \"6031ac9e1289176380734024\"\n}\n```\n\nWhen querying documents in this collection via REST API, you could query as follows:\n\n`?where[owner][equals]=6031ac9e1289176380734024`.\n\n#### Has One - Polymorphic\n\nAlso known as **dynamic references**, in this configuration, the `relationTo` field is an array of Collection slugs that\ntells Payload which Collections are valid to reference.\n\n```ts\n{\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n    fields\n:\n  [\n    {\n      name: 'owner', // required\n      type: 'relationship', // required\n      relationTo: ['users', 'organizations'], // required\n      hasMany: false,\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe shape of the data to save for a document with more than one relationship type would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"owner\": {\n    \"relationTo\": \"organizations\",\n    \"value\": \"6031ac9e1289176380734024\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere is an example for how to query documents by this data (note the difference in referencing the `owner.value`):\n\n`?where[owner.value][equals]=6031ac9e1289176380734024`.\n\nYou can also query for documents where a field has a relationship to a specific Collection:\n\n`?where[owners.relationTo][equals]=organizations`.\n\nThis query would return only documents that have an owner relationship to organizations.\n\n#### Has Many\n\nThe `hasMany` tells Payload that there may be more than one collection saved to the field.\n\n```ts\n{\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n    fields\n:\n  [\n    {\n      name: 'owners', // required\n      type: 'relationship', // required\n      relationTo: 'users', // required\n      hasMany: true,\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo save the to `hasMany` relationship field we need to send an array of IDs:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"owners\": [\n    \"6031ac9e1289176380734024\",\n    \"602c3c327b811235943ee12b\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWhen querying documents, the format does not change for arrays:\n\n`?where[owners][equals]=6031ac9e1289176380734024`.\n\n#### Has Many - Polymorphic\n\n```ts\n{\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n    fields\n:\n  [\n    {\n      name: 'owners', // required\n      type: 'relationship', // required\n      relationTo: ['users', 'organizations'], // required\n      hasMany: true,\n      required: true,\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nRelationship fields with `hasMany` set to more than one kind of collections save their data as an array of objects—each\ncontaining the Collection `slug` as the `relationTo` value, and the related document `id` for the `value`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"owners\": [\n    {\n      \"relationTo\": \"users\",\n      \"value\": \"6031ac9e1289176380734024\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"relationTo\": \"organizations\",\n      \"value\": \"602c3c327b811235943ee12b\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nQuerying is done in the same way as the earlier Polymorphic example:\n\n`?where[owners.value][equals]=6031ac9e1289176380734024`.\n\n#### Querying and Filtering Polymorphic Relationships\n\nPolymorphic and non-polymorphic relationships must be queried differently because of how the related data is stored and\nmay be inconsistent across different collections. Because of this, filtering polymorphic relationship fields from the\nCollection List admin UI is limited to the `id` value.\n\nFor a polymorphic relationship, the response will always be an array of objects. Each object will contain\nthe `relationTo` and `value` properties.\n\nThe data can be queried by the related document ID:\n\n`?where[field.value][equals]=6031ac9e1289176380734024`.\n\nOr by the related document Collection slug:\n\n`?where[field.relationTo][equals]=your-collection-slug`.\n\nHowever, you **cannot** query on any field values within the related document.\nSince we are referencing multiple collections, the field you are querying on may not exist and break the query.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  You <strong>cannot</strong> query on a field within a polymorphic relationship as you would with a non-polymorphic relationship.\n</Banner>\n",

(Only works\nwhen `hasMany` is set to `true`)\n\n### Example\n\n`collections/ExampleCollection.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'selectedFeatures', // required\n      type: 'select', // required\n      hasMany: true,\n      admin: {\n        isClearable: true,\n        isSortable: true, // use mouse to drag and drop different values, and sort them according to your choice\n      },\n      options: [\n        {\n          label: 'Metallic Paint',\n          value: 'metallic_paint',\n        },\n        {\n          label: 'Alloy Wheels',\n          value: 'alloy_wheels',\n        },\n        {\n          label: 'Carbon Fiber Dashboard',\n          value: 'carbon_fiber_dashboard',\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n### Customization\n\nThe Select field UI component can be customized by providing a custom React component to the `components` object in the\nBase config.\n\n```ts\nexport const CustomSelectField: Field = {\n  name: 'customSelectField',\n  type: 'select', // or 'text' if you have dynamic options\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      Field: CustomSelectComponent({\n        options: [\n          {\n            label: 'Option 1',\n            value: '1',\n          },\n          {\n            label: 'Option 2',\n            value: '2',\n          },\n        ],\n      }),\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can import the existing Select component directly from Payload, then extend and customize it as needed.\n\n```ts\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { SelectInput, useField } from 'payload/components/forms';\nimport { useAuth } from 'payload/components/utilities';\n\ntype CustomSelectProps = {\n  path: string;\n  options: {\n    label: string;\n    value: string;\n  }[];\n}\n\nexport const CustomSelectComponent: React.FC<CustomSelectProps> = ({ path, options }) => {\n  const { value, setValue } = useField<string>({ path })\n  const { user } = useAuth()\n\n  const adjustedOptions = options.filter((option) => {\n    /*\n      A common use case for a custom select\n      is to show different options based on\n      the current user's role.\n    */\n    return option;\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <label className = \"field-label\" >\n      Custom\n  Select\n  < /label>\n  < SelectInput\n  path = { path }\n  name = { path }\n  options = { adjustedOptions }\n  value = { value }\n  onChange = {(e)\n=>\n  setValue(e.value)\n}\n  />\n  < /div>\n)\n}\n```\n\nIf you are looking to create a dynamic select field, the following tutorial will walk you through the process of\ncreating a custom select field that fetches its options from an external API.\n\n<VideoDrawer\nid='Efn9OxSjA6Y'\nlabel='How to Create a Custom Select Field'\ndrawerTitle='How to Create a Custom Select Field: A Step-by-Step Guide'\n/>\n\nIf you want to learn more about custom components check out\nthe [Admin > Custom Component](../admin/components#field-component) docs.\n",

You can customize or override the fields and settings of the default `User` Collection by passing your own collection using `users` as its `slug` to Payload. When this is done, Payload will use your provided `User` Collection instead of its default version.\n\n**Note: you can use whatever Collection you'd like to access the Admin panel as long as the Collection supports Authentication. It doesn't need to be called `users`!**\n\nFor example, you may wish to have two Collections that both support `Authentication`:\n\n- `admins` - meant to have a higher level of permissions to manage your data and access the Admin panel\n- `customers` - meant for end users of your app that should not be allowed to log into the Admin panel\n\nThis is totally possible. For the above scenario, by specifying `admin: { user: 'admins' }`, your Payload Admin panel will use `admins`. Any users logged in as `customers` will not be able to log in via the Admin panel.\n\n### Light and dark modes\n\nUsers in the admin panel have access to choosing between light mode and dark mode for their editing experience. The setting is managed while logged into the admin UI within the user account page and will be stored with the browser. By default, the operating system preference is detected and used.\n\n### Restricting user access\n\nIf you would like to restrict which users from a single Collection can access the Admin panel, you can use the `admin` access control function.

There are many times where you may want to completely control how a whole view or a field works. You might even want to add in new views entirely. In order for Payload to support this level of customization without introducing versioning / future-proofing issues, Payload provides for a pattern to supply your own React components via your Payload config.\n\nTo swap in your own React component, first, consult the list of available component overrides below. Determine the scope that corresponds to what you are trying to accomplish, and then author your React component accordingly.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  <br />\n  Custom components will automatically be provided with all props that the default component normally\n  accepts.\n</Banner>\n\n### Base Component Overrides\n\nYou can override a set of admin panel-wide components by providing a component to your base Payload config's `admin.components` property.

[Demo](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/test/admin/components/AfterDashboard/index.tsx)   |\n| **`BeforeLogin`**     | Array of components to inject into the built-in Login, _before_ the default login form.                                                                                                                     |\n| **`AfterLogin`**      | Array of components to inject into the built-in Login, _after_ the default login form.                                                                                                                      |\n| **`logout.Button`**   | A custom React component.                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| **`graphics.Icon`**   | Used as a graphic within the `Nav` component. Often represents a condensed version of a full logo.                                                                                                          |\n| **`graphics.Logo`**   | The full logo to be used in contexts like the `Login` view.                                                                                                                                                 |\n| **`providers`**       | Define your own provider components that will wrap the Payload Admin UI.

[More](#views)                                                                                                                                    |\n\nHere is a full example showing how to swap some of these components for your own.\n\n`payload.config.js`\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\n\nimport {\n  MyCustomNav,\n  MyCustomLogo,\n  MyCustomIcon,\n  MyCustomAccount,\n  MyCustomDashboard,\n  MyProvider,\n  MyCustomAdminAction,\n} from './customComponents'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      Nav: MyCustomNav,\n      graphics: {\n        Icon: MyCustomIcon,\n        Logo: MyCustomLogo,\n      },\n      actions: [MyCustomAdminAction],\n      views: {\n        Account: MyCustomAccount,\n        Dashboard: MyCustomDashboard,\n      },\n      providers: [MyProvider],\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n#### Views\n\nYou can easily swap entire views with your own by using the `admin.components.views` property. At the root level, Payload renders the following views by default, all of which can be overridden:\n\n| Property           | Description                                                                                                                  |\n| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`Account`**      | The Account view is used to show the currently logged in user's Account page.                                                |\n| **`Dashboard`**    | The main landing page of the Admin panel.                                                                                    |\n\nTo swap out any of these views, simply pass in your custom component to the `admin.components.views` property of your Payload config. For example:\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      views: {\n        Account: MyCustomAccountView,\n        Dashboard: MyCustomDashboardView,\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nFor more granular control, pass a configuration object instead. Each view corresponds to its own `<Route />` component in [React Router v5](https://v5.reactrouter.com). Payload exposes all of the properties of React Router:\n\n| Property           | Description                                                                                                                  |\n| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`Component`** \\* | Pass in the component that should be rendered when a user navigates to this route.                                           |\n| **`path`** \\*      | React Router `path`. [See the React Router docs](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/Route/path-string-string) for more info. |\n| **`exact`**        | React Router `exact` property. [More](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/Route/exact-bool)                                   |\n| **`strict`**       | React Router `strict` property. [More](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/Route/strict-bool)                                 |\n| **`sensitive`**    | React Router `sensitive` property. [More](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/Route/sensitive-bool)                           |\n\n_\\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._\n\n#### Adding new views\n\nTo add a _new_ view to the Admin Panel, simply add another key to the `views` object with at least a `path` and `Component` property. For example:\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      views: {\n        MyCustomView: {\n          Component: MyCustomView,\n          path: '/my-custom-view',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  Routes are cascading. This means that unless explicitly given the `exact` property, they will match on URLs that simply _start_ with the route's path. This is helpful when creating catch-all routes in your application. Alternatively, you could define your nested route _before_ your parent route.\n</Banner>\n\n_For more examples regarding how to customize components, look at the following [examples](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/test/admin/components)._\n\nFor help on how to build your own custom view components, see [building a custom view component](#building-a-custom-view-component).\n\n### Collections\n\nYou can override components on a collection-by-collection basis via the `admin.components` property.\n\n| Path                       | Description                                                                                                            |\n| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`BeforeList`**           | Array of components to inject _before_ the built-in List view                                                          |\n| **`BeforeListTable`**      | Array of components to inject _before_ the built-in List view's table                                                  |\n| **`AfterList`**            | Array of components to inject _after_ the built-in List view                                                           |\n| **`AfterListTable`**       | Array of components to inject _after_ the built-in List view's table                                                   |\n| **`edit.SaveButton`**      | Replace the default `Save` button with a custom component.

Payload renders the following views by default, all of which can be overridden:\n\n| Property           | Description                                                                                                                  |\n| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`Edit`**         | The Edit view is used to edit a single document for a given collection.                                                      |\n| **`List`**         | The List view is used to show a list of documents for a given collection.                                                    |\n\nTo swap out any of these views, simply pass in your custom component to the `admin.components.views` property of your Payload config. This will replace the entire view, including the page breadcrumbs, title, tabs, etc, _as well as all nested routes_.\n\n```ts\n// Collection.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      views: {\n        Edit: MyCustomEditView,\n        List: MyCustomListView,\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n_For help on how to build your own custom view components, see [building a custom view component](#building-a-custom-view-component)._\n\n**Customizing Nested Views within 'Edit' in Collections**\n\nThe `Edit` view in collections consists of several nested views, each serving a unique purpose. You can customize these nested views using the `admin.components.views.Edit` property in the collection's configuration. This approach allows you to replace specific nested views while keeping the overall structure of the `Edit` view intact, including the page breadcrumbs, title, tabs, etc.\n\nHere's an example of how you can customize nested views within the `Edit` view in collections, including the use of the `actions` property:\n\n```ts\n// Collection.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      views: {\n        Edit: {\n          Default: {\n            Component: MyCustomDefaultTab,\n            actions: [CollectionEditButton], // Custom actions for the default edit view\n          },\n          API: {\n            Component: MyCustomAPIView,\n            actions: [CollectionAPIButton], // Custom actions for API view\n          },\n          LivePreview: {\n            Component: MyCustomLivePreviewView,\n            actions: [CollectionLivePreviewButton], // Custom actions for Live Preview\n          },\n          Version: {\n            Component: MyCustomVersionView,\n            actions: [CollectionVersionButton], // Custom actions for Version view\n          },\n          Versions: {\n            Component: MyCustomVersionsView,\n            actions: [CollectionVersionsButton], // Custom actions for Versions view\n          },\n        },\n        List: {\n          actions: [CollectionListButton],\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n**Adding New Tabs to 'Edit' View**\n\nYou can also add _new_ tabs to the `Edit` view by adding another key to the `components.views.Edit[key]` object with a `path` and `Component` property. See [Custom Tabs](#custom-tabs) for more information.\n\n### Globals\n\nAs with Collections, you can override components on a global-by-global basis via the `admin.components` property.\n\n| Path                           | Description                                                                                                            |\n| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`elements.SaveButton`**      | Replace the default `Save` button with a custom component.

Payload renders the following views by default, all of which can be overridden:\n\n| Property           | Description                                                                                                                  |\n| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`Edit`**         | The Edit view is used to edit a single document for a given Global.                                                          |\n\nTo swap out any of these views, simply pass in your custom component to the `admin.components.views` property of your Payload config.

This includes the ability to swap specific nested views while maintaining the overall structure of the `Edit` view. You can use the `admin.components.views.Edit` property in the Globals configuration to achieve this, and this will only replace the nested view, leaving the page breadcrumbs, title, and tabs intact.\n\nHere's how you can customize nested views within the `Edit` view in Globals, including the use of the `actions` property:\n\n```ts\n// Global.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      views: {\n        Edit: {\n          Default: {\n            Component: MyCustomGlobalDefaultTab,\n            actions: [GlobalEditButton], // Custom actions for the default edit view\n          },\n          API: {\n            Component: MyCustomGlobalAPIView,\n            actions: [GlobalAPIButton], // Custom actions for API view\n          },\n          LivePreview: {\n            Component: MyCustomGlobalLivePreviewView,\n            actions: [GlobalLivePreviewButton], // Custom actions for Live Preview\n          },\n          Version: {\n            Component: MyCustomGlobalVersionView,\n            actions: [GlobalVersionButton], // Custom actions for Version view\n          },\n          Versions: {\n            Component: MyCustomGlobalVersionsView,\n            actions: [GlobalVersionsButton], // Custom actions for Versions view\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nYou can also add _new_ tabs to the `Edit` view by adding another key to the `components.views.Edit[key]` object with a `path` and `Component` property. See [Custom Tabs](#custom-tabs) for more information.\n\n### Custom Tabs\n\nYou can easily swap individual collection or global edit views. To do this, pass an _object_ to the `admin.components.views.Edit` property of the config. Payload renders the following views by default, all of which can be overridden:\n\n| Property           | Description                                                                                                                  |\n| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`Default`**      | The Default view is the primary view in which your document is edited.                                                       |\n| **`Versions`**     | The Versions view is used to view the version history of a single document. [More details](../versions)                      |\n| **`Version`**      | The Version view is used to view a single version of a single document for a given collection. [More details](../versions).  |\n| **`API`**          | The API view is used to display the REST API JSON response for a given document.                                             |\n| **`LivePreview`**  | The LivePreview view is used to display the Live Preview interface. [More details](../live-preview)                          |\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```ts\n// Collection.ts or Global.ts\nexport const MyCollection: SanitizedCollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'my-collection',\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      views: {\n        Edit: { // You can also define `components.views.Edit` as a component, this will override _all_ nested views\n          Default: MyCustomDefaultTab,\n          Versions: MyCustomVersionsTab,\n          Version: MyCustomVersionTab,\n          API: MyCustomAPITab,\n          LivePreview: MyCustomLivePreviewTab,\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nTo add a _new_ tab to the `Edit` view, simply add another key to `components.views.Edit[key]` with at least a `path` and `Component` property. For example:\n\n```ts\n// `Collection.ts` or `Global.ts`\nexport const MyCollection: SanitizedCollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'my-collection',\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      views: {\n        Edit: {\n          MyCustomTab: {\n            Component: MyCustomTab,\n            path: '/my-custom-tab',\n            // You an swap the entire tab component out for your own\n            Tab: MyCustomTab\n          },\n          AnotherCustomView: {\n            Component: AnotherCustomView,\n            path: '/another-custom-view',\n            // Or you can use the default tab component and just pass in your own label and href\n            Tab: {\n              label: 'Another Custom View',\n              href: '/another-custom-view',\n            }\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Building a custom view component\n\nYour custom view components will be given all the props that a React Router `<Route />` typically would receive, as well as two props from Payload:\n\n| Prop                    | Description                                                                  |\n| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`user`**              | The currently logged in user. Will be `null` if no user is logged in.        |\n| **`canAccessAdmin`** \\* | If the currently logged in user is allowed to access the admin panel or not. |\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  It's up to you to secure your custom views. If your view requires a user to be logged in or to\n  have certain access rights, you should handle that within your view component yourself.\n</Banner>\n\n#### Example\n\nYou can find examples of custom views in the [Payload source code `/test/admin/components/views` folder](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/test/admin/components/views). There, you'll find two custom views:\n\n1. A custom view that uses the `DefaultTemplate`, which is the built-in Payload template that displays the sidebar and \"eyebrow nav\"\n1. A custom view that uses the `MinimalTemplate` - which is just a centered template used for things like logging in or out\n\nTo see how to pass in your custom views to create custom views of your own, take a look at the `admin.components.views` property of the [Payload test admin config](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/test/admin/config.ts).\n\n### Fields\n\nAll Payload fields support the ability to swap in your own React components. So, for example, instead of rendering a default Text input, you might need to render a color picker that provides the editor with a custom color picker interface to restrict the data entered to colors only.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  <br />\n  Don't see a built-in field type that you need? Build it! Using a combination of custom validation\n  and custom components, you can override the entirety of how a component functions within the admin\n  panel and effectively create your own field type.\n</Banner>\n\n**Fields support the following custom components:**\n\n| Component    | Description                                                                                                                 |\n| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`Filter`** | Override the text input that is presented in the `List` view when a user is filtering documents by the customized field.    |\n| **`Cell`**   | Used in the `List` view's table to represent a table-based preview of the data stored in the field. [More](#cell-component) |\n| **`Field`**  | Swap out the field itself within all `Edit` views. [More](#field-component)                                                 |\n\nAs an alternative to replacing the entire Field component, you may want to keep the majority of the default Field component and only swap components within. This allows you to replace the **`Label`** or **`Error`** within a field component or add additional components inside the field with **`beforeInput`** or **`afterInput`**. **`beforeInput`** and **`afterInput`** are allowed in any fields that don't contain other fields, except [UI](../fields/ui) and [Rich Text](../fields/rich-text).\n\n| Component         | Description                                                                                                     |\n| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`Label`**       | Override the default Label in the Field Component. [More](#label-component)                                     |\n| **`Error`**       | Override the default Error in the Field Component. [More](#error-component)                                     |\n| **`beforeInput`** | An array of elements that will be added before `input`/`textarea` elements. [More](#afterinput-and-beforeinput) |\n| **`afterInput`**  | An array of elements that will be added after `input`/`textarea` elements. [More](#afterinput-and-beforeinput)  |\n\n## Cell Component\n\nThese are the props that will be passed to your custom Cell to use in your own components.\n\n| Property         | Description                                                       |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`field`**      | An object that includes the field configuration.                  |\n| **`colIndex`**   | A unique number for the column in the list.                       |\n| **`collection`** | An object with the config of the collection that the field is in. |\n| **`cellData`**   | The data for the field that the cell represents.                  |\n| **`rowData`**    | An object with all the field values for the row.                  |\n\n#### Example\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport type { Props } from 'payload/components/views/Cell'\nimport './index.scss'\n\nconst baseClass = 'custom-cell'\n\nconst CustomCell: React.FC<Props> = (props) => {\n  const { field, colIndex, collection, cellData, rowData } = props\n\n  return <span className={baseClass}>{cellData}</span>\n}\n```\n\n## Field Component\n\nWhen writing your own custom components you can make use of a number of hooks to set data, get reactive changes to other fields, get the id of the document or interact with a context from a custom provider.\n\n### Sending and receiving values from the form\n\nWhen swapping out the `Field` component, you'll be responsible for sending and receiving the field's `value` from the form itself. To do so, import the `useField` hook as follows:\n\n```tsx\nimport { useField } from 'payload/components/forms'\n\nconst CustomTextField: React.FC<{ path: string }> = ({ path }) => {\n  // highlight-start\n  const { value, setValue } = useField<string>({ path })\n  // highlight-end\n\n\n  return <input onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} value={value} />\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  For more information regarding the hooks that are available to you while you build custom\n  components, including the <strong>useField</strong> hook, [click here](../admin/hooks).\n</Banner>\n\n## Label Component\n\nThese are the props that will be passed to your custom Label.\n\n| Property         | Description                                                      |\n| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`htmlFor`**    | Property used to set `for` attribute for label.                  |\n| **`label`**      | Label value provided in field, it can be used with i18n.         |\n| **`required`**   | A boolean value that represents if the field is required or not. |\n\n#### Example\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next'\n\nimport { getTranslation } from 'payload/utilities/getTranslation'\n\ntype Props = {\n  htmlFor?: string\n  label?: Record<string, string> | false | string\n  required?: boolean\n}\n\nconst CustomLabel: React.FC<Props> = (props) => {\n  const { htmlFor, label, required = false } = props\n\n  const { i18n } = useTranslation()\n\n  if (label) {\n    return (<span>\n      {getTranslation(label, i18n)}\n      {required && <span className=\"required\">*</span>}\n    </span>);\n  }\n\n  return null\n}\n```\n\n## Error Component\n\nThese are the props that will be passed to your custom Error.\n\n| Property         | Description                                                   |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`message`**    | The error message.                                            |\n| **`showError`**  | A boolean value that represents if the error should be shown. |\n\n#### Example\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react'\n\ntype Props = {\n  message: string\n  showError?: boolean\n}\n\nconst CustomError: React.FC<Props> = (props) => {\n  const { message, showError } = props\n\n  if (showError) {\n    return <p style={{color: 'red'}}>{message}</p>\n  } else return null;\n}\n```\n\n## afterInput and beforeInput\n\nWith these properties you can add multiple components before and after the input element. For example, you can add an absolutely positioned button to clear the current field value.\n\n#### Example\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { Field } from 'payload/types'\n\nimport './style.scss'\n\nconst ClearButton: React.FC = () => {\n  return <button onClick={() => {/* ... */}}>X</button>\n}\n\nconst titleField: Field = {\n  name: 'title',\n  type: 'text',\n  admin: {\n    components: {\n      afterInput: [ClearButton]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nexport default titleField;\n```\n\n## Custom providers\n\nAs your admin customizations gets more complex you may want to share state between fields or other components. You can add custom providers to add your own context to any Payload app for use in other custom components within the admin panel. Within your config add `admin.components.providers`, these can be used to share context or provide other custom functionality. Read the [React context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) docs to learn more.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Reminder:</strong> Don't forget to pass the **children** prop through the provider\n  component for the admin UI to show\n</Banner>\n\n### Styling Custom Components\n\nPayload exports its SCSS variables and mixins for reuse in your own custom components. This is helpful in cases where you might want to style a custom input similarly to Payload's built-in styling, so it blends more thoroughly into the existing admin UI.\n\nTo make use of Payload SCSS variables / mixins to use directly in your own components, you can import them as follows:\n\n```\n@import '~payload/scss';\n```\n\n### Getting the current language\n\nWhen developing custom components you can support multiple languages to be consistent with Payload's i18n support. The best way to do this is to add your translation resources to the [i18n configuration](../configuration/i18n) and import `useTranslation` from `react-i18next` in your components.\n\nFor example:\n\n```tsx\nimport { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next'\n\nconst CustomComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  // highlight-start\n  const { t, i18n } = useTranslation('namespace1')\n  // highlight-end\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      <li>{t('key', { variable: 'value' })}</li>\n      <li>{t('namespace2:key', { variable: 'value' })}</li>\n      <li>{i18n.language}</li>\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Getting the current locale\n\nIn any custom component you can get the selected locale with `useLocale` hook. `useLocale` returns the full locale object, consisting of a `label`, `rtl`(right-to-left) property, and then `code`. Here is a simple example:\n\n```tsx\nimport { useLocale } from 'payload/components/utilities'\n\nconst Greeting: React.FC = () => {\n  // highlight-start\n  const locale = useLocale()\n  // highlight-end\n\n  const trans = {\n    en: 'Hello',\n    es: 'Hola',\n  }\n\n  return <span> {trans[locale.code]} </span>\n}\n```\n",

        "content": "\nPayload provides a variety of powerful hooks that can be used within your own React components. With them, you can interface with Payload itself and build just about any type of complex customization you can think of—directly in familiar React code.\n\n### useField\n\nThe `useField` hook is used internally within every applicable Payload field component, and it manages sending and receiving a field's state from its parent form.\n\nOutside of internal use, its most common use-case is in custom `Field` components. When you build a custom React `Field` component, you'll be responsible for sending and receiving the field's `value` from the form itself. To do so, import the `useField` hook as follows:\n\n```tsx\nimport { useField } from 'payload/components/forms'\n\ntype Props = { path: string }\n\nconst CustomTextField: React.FC<Props> = ({ path }) => {\n  // highlight-start\n  const { value, setValue } = useField<string>({ path })\n  // highlight-end\n\n  return <input onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} value={value.path} />\n}\n```\n\nThe `useField` hook accepts an `args` object and sends back information and helpers for you to make use of:\n\n```ts\nconst field = useField<string>({\n  path: 'fieldPathHere', // required\n  validate: myValidateFunc, // optional\n  disableFormData?: false, // if true, the field's data will be ignored\n  condition?: myConditionHere, // optional, used to skip validation if condition fails\n})\n\n// Here is what `useField` sends back\nconst {\n  showError, // whether or not the field should show as errored\n  errorMessage, // the error message to show, if showError\n  value, // the current value of the field from the form\n  formSubmitted, // if the form has been submitted\n  formProcessing, // if the form is currently processing\n  setValue, // method to set the field's value in form state\n  initialValue, // the initial value that the field mounted with\n} = field;\n\n// The rest of your component goes here\n```\n\n### useFormFields\n\nThere are times when a custom field component needs to have access to data from other fields, and you have a few options to do so. The `useFormFields` hook is a powerful and highly performant way to retrieve a form's field state, as well as to retrieve the `dispatchFields` method, which can be helpful for setting other fields' form states from anywhere within a form.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>This hook is great for retrieving only certain fields from form state</strong> because it\n  ensures that it will only cause a rerender when the items that you ask for change.\n</Banner>\n\nThanks to the awesome package [`use-context-selector`](https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector), you can retrieve a specific field's state easily. This is ideal because you can ensure you have an up-to-date field state, and your component will only re-render when _that field's state_ changes.\n\nYou can pass a Redux-like selector into the hook, which will ensure that you retrieve only the field that you want. The selector takes an argument with type of `[fields: Fields, dispatch: React.Dispatch<Action>]]`.\n\n```tsx\nimport { useFormFields } from 'payload/components/forms'\n\nconst MyComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  // Get only the `amount` field state, and only cause a rerender when that field changes\n  const amount = useFormFields(([fields, dispatch]) => fields.amount)\n\n  // Do the same thing as above, but to the `feePercentage` field\n  const feePercentage = useFormFields(([fields, dispatch]) => fields.feePercentage)\n\n  if (typeof amount?.value !== 'undefined' && typeof feePercentage?.value !== 'undefined') {\n    return <span>The fee is ${(amount.value * feePercentage.value) / 100}</span>\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### useAllFormFields\n\n**To retrieve more than one field**, you can use the `useAllFormFields` hook. Your component will re-render when _any_ field changes, so use this hook only if you absolutely need to. Unlike the `useFormFields` hook, this hook does not accept a \"selector\", and it always returns an array with type of `[fields: Fields, dispatch: React.Dispatch<Action>]]`.\n\nYou can do lots of powerful stuff by retrieving the full form state, like using built-in helper functions to reduce field state to values only, or to retrieve sibling data by path.\n\n```tsx\nimport { useAllFormFields, reduceFieldsToValues, getSiblingData } from 'payload/components/forms';\n\nconst ExampleComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  // the `fields` const will be equal to all fields' state,\n  // and the `dispatchFields` method is usable to send field state up to the form\n  const [fields, dispatchFields] = useAllFormFields();\n\n  // Pass in fields, and indicate if you'd like to \"unflatten\" field data.\n  // The result below will reflect the data stored in the form at the given time\n  const formData = reduceFieldsToValues(fields, true);\n\n  // Pass in field state and a path,\n  // and you will be sent all sibling data of the path that you've specified\n  const siblingData = getSiblingData(fields, 'someFieldName');\n\n  return (\n    // return some JSX here if necessary\n  )\n};\n```\n\n##### Updating other fields' values\n\nIf you are building a custom component, then you should use `setValue` which is returned from the `useField` hook to programmatically set your field's value. But if you're looking to update _another_ field's value, you can use `dispatchFields` returned from `useFormFields`.\n\nYou can send the following actions to the `dispatchFields` function.\n\n| Action                 | Description                                                                |\n| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`ADD_ROW`**          | Adds a row of data (useful in array / block field data)                    |\n| **`DUPLICATE_ROW`**    | Duplicates a row of data (useful in array / block field data)              |\n| **`MODIFY_CONDITION`** | Updates a field's conditional logic result (true / false)                  |\n| **`MOVE_ROW`**         | Moves a row of data (useful in array / block field data)                   |\n| **`REMOVE`**           | Removes a field from form state                                            |\n| **`REMOVE_ROW`**       | Removes a row of data from form state (useful in array / block field data) |\n| **`REPLACE_STATE`**    | Completely replaces form state                                             |\n| **`UPDATE`**           | Update any property of a specific field's state                            |\n\nTo see types for each action supported within the `dispatchFields` hook, check out the Form types [here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/packages/payload/src/admin/components/forms/Form/types.ts).\n\n### useForm\n\nThe `useForm` hook can be used to interact with the form itself, and sends back many methods that can be used to reactively fetch form state without causing rerenders within your components each time a field is changed. This is useful if you have action-based callbacks that your components fire, and need to interact with form state _based on a user action_.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Warning:</strong>\n  <br />\n  This hook is optimized to avoid causing rerenders when fields change, and as such, its `fields`\n  property will be out of date. You should only leverage this hook if you need to perform actions\n  against the form in response to your users' actions. Do not rely on its returned \"fields\" as being\n  up-to-date. They will be removed from this hook's response in an upcoming version.\n</Banner>\n\nThe `useForm` hook returns an object with the following properties: |\n\n<TableWithDrawers\n  columns={[\n    'Action',\n    'Description',\n    'Example',\n  ]}\n  rows={[\n    [\n      {\n        value: <strong><code>fields</code></strong>,\n      },\n      {\n        value: \"Deprecated.

Customize the styling of any part of the Payload dashboard as necessary.\n\nTo do so, provide your base Payload config with a path to your own stylesheet. It can be either a CSS or SCSS file.\n\n**Example in payload.config.js:**\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport path from 'path'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  admin: {\n    css: path.resolve(__dirname, 'relative/path/to/stylesheet.scss'),\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Overriding built-in styles\n\nTo make it as easy as possible for you to override our styles, Payload uses [BEM naming conventions](http://getbem.com/) for all CSS within the Admin UI. If you provide your own CSS, you can override any built-in styles easily.\n\nIn addition to adding your own style definitions, you can also override Payload's built-in CSS variables. We use as much as possible behind the scenes, and you can override any of them that you'd like to.\n\nYou can find the built-in Payload CSS variables within [`./src/admin/scss/app.scss`](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/packages/payload/src/admin/scss/app.scss) and [`./src/admin/scss/colors.scss`](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/packages/payload/src/admin/scss/colors.scss). The following variables are defined and can be overridden:\n\n- Breakpoints\n- Base color shades (white to black by default)\n- Success / warning / error color shades\n- Theme-specific colors (background, input background, text color, etc.)\n- Elevation colors (used to determine how \"bright\" something should be when compared to the background)\n- Fonts\n- Horizontal gutter\n\n#### Dark mode\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  If you're overriding colors or theme elevations, make sure to consider how your changes will\n  affect dark mode.\n</Banner>\n\nBy default, Payload automatically overrides all `--theme-elevation`s and inverts all success / warning / error shades to suit dark mode. We also update some base theme variables like `--theme-bg`, `--theme-text`, etc.\n",

        "content": "\nAs your users interact with your Admin panel, you might want to store their preferences in a persistent manner, so that when they revisit the Admin panel, they can pick right back up where they left off.\n\nOut of the box, Payload handles the persistence of your users' preferences in a handful of ways, including:\n\n1. Collection `List` view active columns, and their order, that users define\n1. Their last active locale\n1. The \"collapsed\" state of blocks, on a document level, as users edit or interact with documents\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong>\n  <br />\n  All preferences are stored on an individual user basis. Payload automatically recognizes the user\n  that is reading or setting a preference via all provided authentication methods.\n</Banner>\n\n### Use cases\n\nThis API is used significantly for internal operations of the Admin panel, as mentioned above. But, if you're building your own React components for use in the Admin panel, you can allow users to set their own preferences in correspondence to their usage of your components. For example:\n\n- If you have built a \"color picker\", you could \"remember\" the last used colors that the user has set for easy access next time\n- If you've built a custom `Nav` component, and you've built in an \"accordion-style\" UI, you might want to store the `collapsed` state of each Nav collapsible item. This way, if an editor returns to the panel, their `Nav` state is persisted automatically\n- You might want to store `recentlyAccessed` documents to give admin editors an easy shortcut back to their recently accessed documents on the `Dashboard` or similar\n- Many other use cases exist. Invent your own! Give your editors an intelligent and persistent editing experience.\n\n### Database\n\nPayload automatically creates an internally used `payload-preferences` collection that stores user preferences. Each document in the `payload-preferences` collection contains the following shape:\n\n| Key               | Value                                                             |\n| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `id`              | A unique ID for each preference stored.                           |\n| `key`             | A unique `key` that corresponds to the preference.                |\n| `user.value`      | The ID of the `user` that is storing its preference.              |\n| `user.relationTo` | The `slug` of the collection that the `user` is logged in as.     |\n| `value`           | The value of the preference. Can be any data shape that you need. |\n| `createdAt`       | A timestamp of when the preference was created.                   |\n| `updatedAt`       | A timestamp set to the last time the preference was updated.      |\n\n### APIs\n\nPreferences are available to both [GraphQL](../graphql/overview#preferences) and [REST](../rest-api/overview#) APIs.\n\n### Adding or reading Preferences in your own components\n\nThe Payload admin panel offers a `usePreferences` hook. The hook is only meant for use within the admin panel itself. It provides you with two methods:\n\n##### `getPreference`\n\nThis async method provides an easy way to retrieve a user's preferences by `key`. It will return a promise containing the resulting preference value.\n\n**Arguments**\n\n- `key`: the `key` of your preference to retrieve.\n\n##### `setPreference`\n\nAlso async, this method provides you with an easy way to set a user preference. It returns `void`.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n- `key`: the `key` of your preference to set.\n- `value`: the `value` of your preference that you're looking to set.\n\n## Example\n\nHere is an example for how you can utilize `usePreferences` within your custom Admin panel components. Note - this example is not fully useful and is more just a reference for how to utilize the Preferences API. In this case, we are demonstrating how to set and retrieve a user's last used colors history within a `ColorPicker` or similar type component.\n\n```\nimport React, { Fragment, useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';\nimport { usePreferences } from 'payload/components/preferences';\n\nconst lastUsedColorsPreferenceKey = 'last-used-colors';\n\nconst CustomComponent = (props) => {\n  const { getPreference, setPreference } = usePreferences();\n\n  // Store the last used colors in local state\n  const [lastUsedColors, setLastUsedColors] = useState([]);\n\n  // Callback to add a color to the last used colors\n  const updateLastUsedColors = useCallback((color) => {\n    // First, check if color already exists in last used colors.\n    // If it already exists, there is no need to update preferences\n    const colorAlreadyExists = lastUsedColors.indexOf(color) > -1;\n\n    if (!colorAlreadyExists) {\n      const newLastUsedColors = [\n        ...lastUsedColors,\n        color,\n      ];\n\n      setLastUsedColors(newLastUsedColors);\n      setPreference(lastUsedColorsPreferenceKey, newLastUsedColors);\n    }\n  }, [lastUsedColors, setPreference]);\n\n  // Retrieve preferences on component mount\n  // This will only be run one time, because the `getPreference` method never changes\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const asyncGetPreference = async () => {\n      const lastUsedColorsFromPreferences = await getPreference(lastUsedColorsPreferenceKey);\n      setLastUsedColors(lastUsedColorsFromPreferences);\n    };\n\n    asyncGetPreference();\n  }, [getPreference]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button\n        type=\"button\"\n        onClick={() => updateLastUsedColors('red')}\n      >\n        Use red\n      </button>\n      <button\n        type=\"button\"\n        onClick={() => updateLastUsedColors('blue')}\n      >\n        Use blue\n      </button>\n      <button\n        type=\"button\"\n        onClick={() => updateLastUsedColors('purple')}\n      >\n        Use purple\n      </button>\n      <button\n        type=\"button\"\n        onClick={() => updateLastUsedColors('yellow')}\n      >\n        Use yellow\n      </button>\n      {lastUsedColors && (\n        <Fragment>\n          <h5>Last used colors:</h5>\n          <ul>\n            {lastUsedColors?.map((color) => (\n              <li key={color}>\n                {color}\n              </li>\n            ))}\n          </ul>\n        </Fragment>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default CustomComponent;\n```\n",

The admin UI has a root `index.html` entry point, and from there the bundler traverses the dependency tree, bundling all of the files that are required from that point on.\n\nSince the bundled file is sent to the browser, it can't include any server-only code. You will need to remove any server-only code from your admin UI before bundling it. You can learn more about [excluding server code](../admin/excluding-server-code) section.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Using environment variables in the admin UI</strong>\n  <br />\n  Bundles should not contain sensitive information. By default, Payload\n  excludes env variables from the bundle.

Although creating a beforeChange hook is a completely valid spot to do things like\n  create subscriptions, the code above is incomplete and insecure, meant for explanation purposes\n  only.\n</Banner>\n\n**As-is, this collection will prevent your Admin panel from bundling or loading correctly, because Stripe relies on some Node-only packages.**\n\n#### How to fix this\n\nYou need to make sure that you use `alias`es to tell your bundler to import \"safe\" files vs. attempting to import any server-side code that you need to get rid of. Depending on your bundler (Webpack, Vite, etc.) the steps involved may be slightly different.\n\nThe basic idea is to create a file that exports an empty object, and then alias import paths of any files that import server-only modules to that empty object file.\n\nThis way when your bundler goes to import a file that contains server-only modules, it will instead import the empty object file, which will not break the browser bundle.\n\n### Aliasing server-only modules\n\nTo remove files that contain server-only modules from your bundle, you can use an `alias`.\n\nIn the Subscriptions config file above, we are importing the hook like so:\n\n```ts\n// collections/Subscriptions/index.ts\n\nimport createStripeSubscription from './hooks/createStripeSubscription'\n```\n\nBy default the browser bundle will now include all the code from that file and any files down the tree. We know that the file imports `stripe`.\n\nTo fix this, we need to alias the `createStripeSubscription` file to a different file that can safely be included in the browser bundle.\n\nFirst, we will create a mock file to replace the server-only file when bundling:\n```js\n// mocks/modules.js\n\nexport default {}\n\n/**\n * NOTE: if you are destructuring an import\n * the mock file will need to export matching\n * variables as the destructured object.\n *\n * export const namedExport = {}\n */\n```\n\nAliasing with [Webpack](../admin/webpack) can be done by:\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport { webpackBundler } from '@payloadcms/bundler-webpack'\n\nimport { Subscriptions } from './collections/Subscriptions'\n\nconst mockModulePath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'mocks/emptyObject.js')\nconst fullFilePath = path.resolve(\n  __dirname,\n  'collections/Subscriptions/hooks/createStripeSubscription'\n)\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  collections: [Subscriptions],\n  admin: {\n    bundler: webpackBundler(),\n    webpack: (config) => {\n      return {\n        ...config,\n        resolve: {\n          ...config.resolve,\n          // highlight-start\n          alias: {\n            ...config.resolve.alias,\n            [fullFilePath]: mockModulePath,\n          },\n          // highlight-end\n        },\n      }\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\nAliasing with [Vite](../admin/vite) can be done by:\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport { viteBundler } from '@payloadcms/bundler-vite'\n\nimport { Subscriptions } from './collections/Subscriptions'\n\nconst mockModulePath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'mocks/emptyObject.js')\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  collections: [Subscriptions],\n  admin: {\n    bundler: viteBundler(),\n    vite: (incomingViteConfig) => {\n      const existingAliases = incomingViteConfig?.resolve?.alias || {};\n      let aliasArray: { find: string | RegExp; replacement: string; }[] = [];\n\n      // Pass the existing Vite aliases\n      if (Array.isArray(existingAliases)) {\n        aliasArray = existingAliases;\n      } else {\n        aliasArray = Object.values(existingAliases);\n      }\n\n\n      // highlight-start\n      // Add your own aliases using the find and replacement keys\n      // remember, vite aliases are exact-match only\n      aliasArray.push({\n        find: '../server-only-module',\n        replacement: path.resolve(__dirname, './path/to/browser-safe-module.js')\n      });\n      // highlight-end\n\n      return {\n        ...incomingViteConfig,\n        resolve: {\n          ...(incomingViteConfig?.resolve || {}),\n          alias: aliasArray,\n        }\n      };\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n",

If you would like to help us test this package, we'd love to hear from you if you find any [bugs or issues](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues/)!\n</Banner>\n\nPayload has a Vite bundler that you can install and bundle the Admin Panel with. This is an alternative to the [Webpack](../admin/webpack) bundler and might give some performance boosts to your development workflow.\n\nTo use Vite as your bundler, first you need to install the package:\n\n```bash\nyarn add @payloadcms/bundler-vite\n```\n\nThen you will need to add the [bundler](../admin/bundlers) to your Payload config:\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from '@payloadcms/config'\nimport { viteBundler } from '@payloadcms/bundler-vite'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  collections: [],\n  admin: {\n    bundler: viteBundler(),\n  }\n})\n```\n\nVite works fundamentally differently than Webpack. In development mode, it will first pre-bundle any of your dependencies that are CommonJS-only, and then it'll leverage ESM directly in your browser for a better HMR experience.\n\nIt then uses Rollup to create production builds of your admin UI. With Vite, you should see a decent performance boost—especially after your first cold start. However, that first cold start might take a few more seconds.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  In most cases, Vite should work out of the box. But existing Payload plugins may need to make compatibility changes to support Vite.\n</Banner>\n\nThis is because Vite aliases work fundamentally differently than Webpack aliases, and Payload relies on aliasing server-only code out of the Payload config to ensure that the bundled admin JS works within your browser.\n\nHere are the main differences between how Vite aliases work and how Webpack aliases work.\n\n**Vite aliases do not work with absolute paths.**\n\nIn Vite, alias keys must <strong>exactly match</strong> a import paths. If you have 2 files that import the same server-only module, but have different import paths, you would need to add 2 aliases to support both import paths.\n\n```ts\n// File A\nimport serverOnlyModule from '../server-only-module'\n\n// File B\nimport serverOnlyModule from '../../server-only-module'\n\n// payload.config.ts\n// You would need to add 2 aliases to support both import paths\nexport const buildConfig({\n  collections: [],\n  admin: {\n    bundler: viteBundler(),\n    vite: (incomingViteConfig) => {\n      const existingAliases = incomingViteConfig?.resolve?.alias || {};\n      let aliasArray: { find: string | RegExp; replacement: string; }[] = [];\n\n      // Pass the existing Vite aliases\n      if (Array.isArray(existingAliases)) {\n        aliasArray = existingAliases;\n      } else {\n        aliasArray = Object.values(existingAliases);\n      }\n\n      // Add your own aliases using the find and replacement keys\n      aliasArray.push({\n        find: '../server-only-module',\n        replacement: path.resolve(__dirname, './path/to/browser-safe-module.js')\n        find: '../../server-only-module',\n        replacement: path.resolve(__dirname, './path/to/browser-safe-module.js')\n      });\n\n      return {\n        ...incomingViteConfig,\n        resolve: {\n          ...(incomingViteConfig?.resolve || {}),\n          alias: aliasArray,\n        }\n      };\n    },\n  }\n})\n```\n\n**Vite aliases do not get applied to pre-bundled dependencies.**\n\nThis especially affects plugins, as plugins will be pre-bundled by Vite using `esbuild`. To get around this and support Vite, plugin authors need to configure an alias to their plugin at the top level, so that the alias will work accordingly.\n\nHere's an example. Say your plugin is called `payload-plugin-cool`. It's imported as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport { myCoolPlugin } from 'payload-plugin-cool'\n```\n\nThat plugin should create an alias to support Vite as follows:\n\n```ts\n{\n  // aliases go here\n  find: 'payload-plugin-cool',\n  replacement: path.resolve(__dirname, './my-admin-plugin.js')\n}\n\n```\n\nThis will effectively alias the entire plugin and work with Vite. If the plugin requires admin-specific code, then the `./my-admin-plugin.js` alias target file should reflect any changes necessary to the admin UI that the main server-side plugin performs.\n\n### Extending the Vite config\n\nThe Payload config supports a new property for plugins to be able to extend the Vite config specifically. That property exists on the main Payload config under `admin.vite`. You can check out the [Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html) for more information on what you can do with the Vite config.\n\nIt's a function that takes a Vite config, and returns an updated Vite config. Here's an example:\n\n```ts\nexport const buildConfig({\n  collections: [],\n  admin: {\n    bundler: viteBundler(),\n    vite: (incomingViteConfig) => {\n      const existingAliases = incomingViteConfig?.resolve?.alias || {};\n      let aliasArray: { find: string | RegExp; replacement: string; }[] = [];\n\n      // Pass the existing Vite aliases\n      if (Array.isArray(existingAliases)) {\n        aliasArray = existingAliases;\n      } else {\n        aliasArray = Object.values(existingAliases);\n      }\n\n      // Add your own aliases using the find and replacement keys\n      aliasArray.push({\n        find: '../server-only-module',\n        replacement: path.resolve(__dirname, './path/to/browser-safe-module.js')\n      });\n\n      return {\n        ...incomingViteConfig,\n        resolve: {\n          ...(incomingViteConfig?.resolve || {}),\n          alias: aliasArray,\n        }\n      };\n    },\n  }\n})\n```\n\nLearn more about [aliasing server-only modules](../admin/excluding-server-code#aliasing-server-only-modules).\n\nEven though there is a new property for Vite configs specifically, we have implemented some \"compatibility\" between Webpack and Vite out-of-the-box.\n\nIf your config specifies Webpack aliases, we attempt to leverage them automatically within the Vite config. They are merged into the Vite alias configuration seamlessly and may work out-of-the-box.\n",

If you want to disable a collection from being able to be referenced in Rich\n  Text fields, set the collection admin options of <strong>enableRichTextLink</strong> and{' '}\n  <strong>enableRichTextRelationship</strong> to false.\n</Banner>\n\nRelationship and Upload elements are populated dynamically into your Rich Text field' content. Within the REST and Local APIs, any present RichText `relationship` or `upload` elements will respect the `depth` option that you pass, and will be populated accordingly. In GraphQL, each `richText` field accepts an argument of `depth` for you to utilize.\n\n### TextAlign element\n\nText Alignment is not included by default and can be added to a Rich Text Editor by adding `textAlign` to the list of elements. TextAlign will alter the existing element to include a new `textAlign` field in the resulting JSON. This field can be used in combination with other elements and leaves to position content to the left, center or right.\n\n### Specifying which elements and leaves to allow\n\nTo specify which default elements or leaves should be allowed to be used for this field, define arrays that contain string names for each element or leaf you wish to enable. To specify a custom element or leaf, pass an object with all corresponding properties as outlined below. View the [example](#example) to reference how this all works.\n\n### Building custom elements and leaves\n\nYou can design and build your own Slate elements and leaves to extend the editor with your own functionality. To do so, first start by reading the [SlateJS documentation](https://docs.slatejs.org/) and looking at the [Slate examples](https://www.slatejs.org/examples/richtext) to familiarize yourself with the SlateJS editor as a whole.\n\nOnce you're up to speed with the general concepts involved, you can pass in your own elements and leaves to your field's admin config.\n\n**Both custom elements and leaves are defined via the following config:**\n\n| Property        | Description                                                |\n| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`name`** \\*   | The default name to be used as a `type` for this element.  |\n| **`Button`** \\* | A React component to be rendered in the Rich Text toolbar. |\n| **`plugins`**   | An array of plugins to provide to the Rich Text editor.    |\n| **`type`**      | A type that overrides the default type used by `name`      |\n\nCustom `Element`s also require the `Element` property set to a React component to be rendered as the `Element` within the rich text editor itself.\n\nCustom `Leaf` objects follow a similar pattern but require you to define the `Leaf` property instead.\n\nSpecifying custom `Type`s let you extend your custom elements by adding additional fields to your JSON object.\n\n### Example\n\n`collections/ExampleCollection.ts`\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nimport { slateEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-slate'\n\nexport const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'example-collection',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'content', // required\n      type: 'richText', // required\n      defaultValue: [\n        {\n          children: [{ text: 'Here is some default content for this field' }],\n        },\n      ],\n      required: true,\n      editor: slateEditor({\n        admin: {\n          elements: [\n            'h2',\n            'h3',\n            'h4',\n            'link',\n            'blockquote',\n            {\n              name: 'cta',\n              Button: CustomCallToActionButton,\n              Element: CustomCallToActionElement,\n              plugins: [\n                // any plugins that are required by this element go here\n              ],\n            },\n          ],\n          leaves: [\n            'bold',\n            'italic',\n            {\n              name: 'highlight',\n              Button: CustomHighlightButton,\n              Leaf: CustomHighlightLeaf,\n              plugins: [\n                // any plugins that are required by this leaf go here\n              ],\n            },\n          ],\n          link: {\n            // Inject your own fields into the Link element\n            fields: [\n              {\n                name: 'rel',\n                label: 'Rel Attribute',\n                type: 'select',\n                hasMany: true,\n                options: ['noopener', 'noreferrer', 'nofollow'],\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          upload: {\n            collections: {\n              media: {\n                fields: [\n                  // any fields that you would like to save\n                  // on an upload element in the `media` collection\n                ],\n              },\n            },\n          },\n        },\n      }),\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n### Generating HTML\n\nAs the Rich Text field saves its content in a JSON format, you'll need to render it as HTML yourself. Here is an example for how to generate JSX / HTML from Rich Text content:\n\n```ts\nimport React, { Fragment } from \"react\";\nimport escapeHTML from \"escape-html\";\nimport { Text } from \"slate\";\n\nconst serialize = (children) =>\n  children.map((node, i) => {\n    if (Text.isText(node)) {\n      let text = (\n        <span dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: escapeHTML(node.text) }} />\n      );\n\n      if (node.bold) {\n        text = <strong key={i}>{text}</strong>;\n      }\n\n      if (node.code) {\n        text = <code key={i}>{text}</code>;\n      }\n\n      if (node.italic) {\n        text = <em key={i}>{text}</em>;\n      }\n\n      if (node.text === '') {\n        text = <br />;\n      }\n\n      // Handle other leaf types here...\n\n      return <Fragment key={i}>{text}</Fragment>;\n    }\n\n    if (!node) {\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    switch (node.type) {\n      case \"h1\":\n        return <h1 key={i}>{serialize(node.children)}</h1>;\n      // Iterate through all headings here...\n      case \"h6\":\n        return <h6 key={i}>{serialize(node.children)}</h6>;\n      case \"blockquote\":\n        return <blockquote key={i}>{serialize(node.children)}</blockquote>;\n      case \"ul\":\n        return <ul key={i}>{serialize(node.children)}</ul>;\n      case \"ol\":\n        return <ol key={i}>{serialize(node.children)}</ol>;\n      case \"li\":\n        return <li key={i}>{serialize(node.children)}</li>;\n      case \"link\":\n        return (\n          <a href={escapeHTML(node.url)} key={i}>\n            {serialize(node.children)}\n          </a>\n        );\n\n      default:\n        return <p key={i}>{serialize(node.children)}</p>;\n    }\n  });\n```\n\n<Banner>\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  The above example is for how to render to JSX, although for plain HTML the pattern is similar.\n  Just remove the JSX and return HTML strings instead!\n</Banner>\n\n### Built-in SlateJS Plugins\n\nPayload comes with a few built-in SlateJS plugins which can be extended to make developing your own elements and leaves a bit easier.\n\n#### `shouldBreakOutOnEnter`\n\nPayload's built-in heading elements all allow a \"hard return\" to \"break out\" of the currently active element. For example, if you hit `enter` while typing an `h1`, the `h1` will be \"broken out of\" and you'll be able to continue writing as the default paragraph element.\n\nIf you want to utilize this functionality within your own custom elements, you can do so by adding a custom plugin to your `element` like the following \"large body\" element example:\n\n`customLargeBodyElement.js`:\n\n```ts\nimport Button from './Button'\nimport Element from './Element'\nimport withLargeBody from './plugin'\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'large-body',\n  Button,\n  Element,\n  plugins: [\n    (incomingEditor) => {\n      const editor = incomingEditor\n      const { shouldBreakOutOnEnter } = editor\n\n      editor.shouldBreakOutOnEnter = (element) =>\n        element.type === 'large-body' ? true : shouldBreakOutOnEnter(element)\n\n      return editor\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nAbove, you can see that we are creating a custom SlateJS element with a name of `large-body`. This might render a slightly larger body copy on the frontend of your app(s). We pass it a name, button, and element&mdash;but additionally, we pass it a `plugins` array containing a single SlateJS plugin.\n\nThe plugin itself extends Payload's built-in `shouldBreakOutOnEnter` Slate function to add its own element name to the list of elements that should \"break out\" when the `enter` key is pressed.\n\n### TypeScript\n\nIf you are building your own custom Rich Text elements or leaves, you may benefit from importing the following types:\n\n```ts\nimport type { RichTextCustomElement, RichTextCustomLeaf } from '@payloadcms/richtext-slate'\n```\n",

We want to combine the beauty and polish of the Medium editing experience with the strength and features of the Notion editor - all in one place.\n\nClassically, we've used SlateJS to work toward this goal, but building custom elements into Slate has proven to be more difficult than we'd like, and we've been keeping our options open.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  Payload's Lexical rich text editor is currently in beta. It's stable enough to use as you build on Payload, so if you're up for helping us fine-tune it, you should use it. But if you're looking for stability, use Slate instead.\n</Banner>\n\nLexical is extremely impressive and trivializes a lot of the hard parts of building new elements into a rich text editor. It has a few distinct advantages over Slate, including the following:\n\n1. A \"/\" menu, which allows editors to easily add new elements while never leaving their keyboard\n1. A \"hover\" toolbar that pops up if you select text\n1. It supports Payload blocks natively, directly within your rich text editor\n1. Custom elements, called \"features\", are much easier to build in Lexical vs. Slate\n\nTo use the Lexical editor, first you need to install it:\n\n```\nnpm install @payloadcms/richtext-lexical\n```\n\nOnce you have it installed, you can pass it to your top-level Payload config as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport { lexicalEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    // your collections here\n  ],\n  // Pass the Lexical editor to the root config\n  editor: lexicalEditor({})\n})\n```\n\nYou can also override Lexical settings on a field-by-field basis as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\nimport {\n  lexicalEditor\n} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nexport const Pages: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'pages',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'content',\n      type: 'richText',\n      // Pass the Lexical editor here and override base settings as necessary\n      editor: lexicalEditor({})\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Extending the lexical editor with Features\n\nLexical has been designed with extensibility in mind. Whether you're aiming to introduce new functionalities or tweak the existing ones, Lexical makes it seamless for you to bring those changes to life.\n\n### Features: The Building Blocks\n\nAt the heart of Lexical's customization potential are \"features\". While Lexical ships with a set of default features we believe are essential for most use cases, the true power lies in your ability to redefine, expand, or prune these as needed.\n\nIf you remove all the default features, you're left with a blank editor. You can then add in only the features you need, or you can build your own custom features from scratch.\n\n### Integrating New Features\n\nTo weave in your custom features, utilize the `features` prop when initializing the Lexical Editor. Here's a basic example of how this is done:\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  BlocksFeature,\n  LinkFeature,\n  UploadFeature,\n  lexicalEditor\n} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\nimport { Banner } from '../blocks/Banner'\nimport { CallToAction } from '../blocks/CallToAction'\n\n{\n  editor: lexicalEditor({\n    features: ({ defaultFeatures }) => [\n      ...defaultFeatures,\n      LinkFeature({\n        // Example showing how to customize the built-in fields\n        // of the Link feature\n        fields: [\n          {\n            name: 'rel',\n            label: 'Rel Attribute',\n            type: 'select',\n            hasMany: true,\n            options: ['noopener', 'noreferrer', 'nofollow'],\n            admin: {\n              description:\n                'The rel attribute defines the relationship between a linked resource and the current document.

In the feature props, you can specify the allowed blocks - just like in the Blocks field. |\n| **`TreeViewFeature`**          | No                  | Adds a debug box under the editor, which allows you to see the current editor state live, the dom, as well as time travel. Very useful for debugging                                   |\n\n## Creating your own, custom Feature\n\nCreating your own custom feature requires deep knowledge of the Lexical editor. We recommend you take a look at the [Lexical documentation](https://lexical.dev/docs/intro) first - especially the \"concepts\" section.\n\nNext, take a look at the [features we've already built](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/richtext-lexical/src/field/features) - understanding how they work will help you understand how to create your own. There is no difference between the features included by default and the ones you create yourself - since those features are all isolated from the \"core\", you have access to the same APIs, whether the feature is part of payload or not!\n\n## Converters\n\n### Lexical => HTML\n\nLexical saves data in JSON, but can also generate its HTML representation via two main methods:\n\n1. **Outputting HTML from the Collection:** Create a new field in your collection to convert saved JSON content to HTML. Payload generates and outputs the HTML for use in your frontend.\n2. **Generating HTML on any server** Convert JSON to HTML on-demand on the server.\n\nThe editor comes with built-in HTML serializers, simplifying the process of converting JSON to HTML.\n\n#### Outputting HTML from the Collection\n\nTo add HTML generation directly within the collection, follow the example below:\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nimport {\n  HTMLConverterFeature,\n  lexicalEditor,\n  lexicalHTML\n} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nconst Pages: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'pages',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'nameOfYourRichTextField',\n      type: 'richText',\n      editor: lexicalEditor({\n        features: ({ defaultFeatures }) => [\n          ...defaultFeatures,\n          // The HTMLConverter Feature is the feature which manages the HTML serializers.\n          // If you do not pass any arguments to it, it will use the default serializers.\n          HTMLConverterFeature({}),\n        ],\n      }),\n    },\n    lexicalHTML('nameOfYourRichTextField', { name: 'nameOfYourRichTextField_html' }),\n  ],\n}\n```\nThe `lexicalHTML()` function creates a new field that automatically converts the referenced lexical richText field into HTML through an afterRead hook.\n\n#### Generating HTML anywhere on the server:\n\nIf you wish to convert JSON to HTML ad-hoc, use this code snippet:\n\n```ts\nimport type { SerializedEditorState } from 'lexical'\nimport {\n  type SanitizedEditorConfig,\n  convertLexicalToHTML,\n  consolidateHTMLConverters,\n} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nasync function lexicalToHTML(editorData: SerializedEditorState, editorConfig: SanitizedEditorConfig) {\n  return await convertLexicalToHTML({\n    converters: consolidateHTMLConverters({ editorConfig }),\n    data: editorData,\n  })\n}\n```\nThis method employs `convertLexicalToHTML` from `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical`, which converts the serialized editor state into HTML.\n\nBecause every `Feature` is able to provide html converters, and because the `htmlFeature` can modify those or provide their own, we need to consolidate them with the default html Converters using the `consolidateHTMLConverters` function.\n\n#### Creating your own HTML Converter\n\nHTML Converters are typed as `HTMLConverter`, which contains the node type it should handle, and a function that accepts the serialized node from the lexical editor, and outputs the HTML string. Here's the HTML Converter of the Upload node as an example:\n\n```ts\nimport type { HTMLConverter } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\nimport payload from 'payload'\n\nconst UploadHTMLConverter: HTMLConverter<SerializedUploadNode> = {\n  converter: async ({ node }) => {\n    const uploadDocument = await payload.findByID({\n      id: node.value.id,\n      collection: node.relationTo,\n    })\n    const url = (payload?.config?.serverURL || '') + uploadDocument?.url\n\n    if (!(uploadDocument?.mimeType as string)?.startsWith('image')) {\n      // Only images can be serialized as HTML\n      return ``\n    }\n\n    return `<img src=\"${url}\" alt=\"${uploadDocument?.filename}\" width=\"${uploadDocument?.width}\"  height=\"${uploadDocument?.height}\"/>`\n  },\n  nodeTypes: [UploadNode.getType()], // This is the type of the lexical node that this converter can handle. Instead of hardcoding 'upload' we can get the node type directly from the UploadNode, since it's static.\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, we have access to all the information saved in the node (for the Upload node, this is `value`and `relationTo`) and we can use that to generate the HTML.\n\nThe `convertLexicalToHTML` is part of `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical` automatically handles traversing the editor state and calling the correct converter for each node.\n\n#### Embedding the HTML Converter in your Feature\n\nYou can embed your HTML Converter directly within your custom `Feature`, allowing it to be handled automatically by the `consolidateHTMLConverters` function. Here is an example:\n\n```ts\nexport const UploadFeature = (props?: UploadFeatureProps): FeatureProvider => {\n  return {\n    feature: () => {\n      return {\n        nodes: [\n          {\n            converters: {\n              html: yourHTMLConverter, // <= This is where you define your HTML Converter\n            },\n            node: UploadNode,\n            type: UploadNode.getType(),\n            //...\n          },\n        ],\n        plugins: [/*...*/],\n        props: props,\n        slashMenu: {/*...*/},\n      }\n    },\n    key: 'upload',\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Headless Editor\n\nLexical provides a seamless way to perform conversions between various other formats:\n- HTML to Lexical (or, importing HTML into the lexical editor)\n- Markdown to Lexical (or, importing Markdown into the lexical editor)\n- Lexical to Markdown\n\nA headless editor can perform such conversions outside of the main editor instance. Follow this method to initiate a headless editor:\n\n```ts\nimport { createHeadlessEditor } from '@lexical/headless' // <= make sure this package is installed\nimport {\n  getEnabledNodes,\n  sanitizeEditorConfig,\n} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nconst yourEditorConfig; // <= your editor config here\n\nconst headlessEditor = createHeadlessEditor({\n  nodes: getEnabledNodes({\n    editorConfig: sanitizeEditorConfig(yourEditorConfig),\n  }),\n})\n```\n\n### Getting the editor config\n\nAs you can see, you need to provide an editor config in order to create a headless editor. This is because the editor config is used to determine which nodes & features are enabled, and which converters are used.\n\nTo get the editor config, simply import the default editor config and adjust it - just like you did inside of the `editor: lexicalEditor({})` property:\n\n```ts\nimport { defaultEditorConfig, defaultEditorFeatures } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical' // <= make sure this package is installed\n\nconst yourEditorConfig = defaultEditorConfig\n\n// If you made changes to the features of the field's editor config, you should also make those changes here:\nyourEditorConfig.features = [\n  ...defaultEditorFeatures,\n  // Add your custom features here\n]\n```\n\n### HTML => Lexical\n\nOnce you have your headless editor instance, you can use it to convert HTML to Lexical:\n\n```ts\nimport { $generateNodesFromDOM } from '@lexical/html'\nimport { $getRoot,$getSelection } from 'lexical'\nimport { JSDOM } from 'jsdom';\n\nheadlessEditor.update(() => {\n  // In a headless environment you can use a package such as JSDom to parse the HTML string.\n  const dom = new JSDOM(htmlString)\n\n  // Once you have the DOM instance it's easy to generate LexicalNodes.\n  const nodes = $generateNodesFromDOM(headlessEditor, dom.window.document)\n\n  // Select the root\n  $getRoot().select()\n\n  // Insert them at a selection.\n  const selection = $getSelection()\n  selection.insertNodes(nodes)\n}, { discrete: true })\n\n// Do this if you then want to get the editor JSON\nconst editorJSON = headlessEditor.getEditorState().toJSON()\n```\n\nFunctions prefixed with a `$` can only be run inside of an `editor.update()` or `editorState.read()` callback.\n\nThis has been taken from the [lexical serialization & deserialization docs](https://lexical.dev/docs/concepts/serialization#html---lexical).\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  Using the <code>discrete: true</code> flag ensures instant updates to the editor state. If immediate reading of the updated state isn't necessary, you can omit the flag.\n</Banner>\n\n### Markdown => Lexical\n\nConvert markdown content to the Lexical editor format with the following:\n\n```ts\nimport { $convertFromMarkdownString } from '@lexical/markdown'\nimport { sanitizeEditorConfig } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nconst yourSanitizedEditorConfig = sanitizeEditorConfig(yourEditorConfig) // <= your editor config here\nconst markdown = `# Hello World`\n\nheadlessEditor.update(() => { $convertFromMarkdownString(markdown, yourSanitizedEditorConfig.features.markdownTransformers) }, { discrete: true })\n\n// Do this if you then want to get the editor JSON\nconst editorJSON = headlessEditor.getEditorState().toJSON()\n```\n\n### Lexical => Markdown\n\nExport content from the Lexical editor into Markdown format using these steps:\n\n1. Import your current editor state into the headless editor.\n2. Convert and fetch the resulting markdown string.\n\nHere's the code for it:\n\n```ts\nimport { $convertToMarkdownString } from '@lexical/markdown'\nimport { sanitizeEditorConfig } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\nimport type { SerializedEditorState } from \"lexical\"\n\nconst yourSanitizedEditorConfig = sanitizeEditorConfig(yourEditorConfig) // <= your editor config here\nconst yourEditorState: SerializedEditorState // <= your current editor state here\n\n// Import editor state into your headless editor\ntry {\n  headlessEditor.setEditorState(headlessEditor.parseEditorState(yourEditorState)) // This should commit the editor state immediately\n} catch (e) {\n  logger.error({ err: e }, 'ERROR parsing editor state')\n}\n\n// Export to markdown\nlet markdown: string\nheadlessEditor.getEditorState().read(() => {\n  markdown = $convertToMarkdownString(yourSanitizedEditorConfig?.features?.markdownTransformers)\n})\n```\n\nThe `.setEditorState()` function immediately updates your editor state. Thus, there's no need for the `discrete: true` flag when reading the state afterward.\n\n\n### Lexical => Plain Text\n\nExport content from the Lexical editor into plain text using these steps:\n\n1. Import your current editor state into the headless editor.\n2. Convert and fetch the resulting plain text string.\n\nHere's the code for it:\n\n```ts\nimport type { SerializedEditorState } from \"lexical\"\nimport { $getRoot } from \"lexical\"\n\nconst yourEditorState: SerializedEditorState // <= your current editor state here\n\n// Import editor state into your headless editor\ntry {\n  headlessEditor.setEditorState(headlessEditor.parseEditorState(yourEditorState)) // This should commit the editor state immediately\n} catch (e) {\n  logger.error({ err: e }, 'ERROR parsing editor state')\n}\n\n// Export to plain text\nconst plainTextContent = headlessEditor.getEditorState().read(() => {\n  return $getRoot().getTextContent()\n}) || ''\n```\n\n## Migrating from Slate\n\nWhile both Slate and Lexical save the editor state in JSON, the structure of the JSON is different.\n\n### Migration via SlateToLexicalFeature\n\nOne way to handle this is to just give your lexical editor the ability to read the slate JSON.\n\nSimply add the `SlateToLexicalFeature` to your editor:\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nimport {\n  SlateToLexicalFeature,\n  lexicalEditor,\n} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nconst Pages: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'pages',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'nameOfYourRichTextField',\n      type: 'richText',\n      editor: lexicalEditor({\n        features: ({ defaultFeatures }) => [\n          ...defaultFeatures,\n          SlateToLexicalFeature({})\n        ],\n      }),\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nand done! Now, everytime this lexical editor is initialized, it converts the slate date to lexical on-the-fly. If the data is already in lexical format, it will just pass it through.\n\nThis is by far the easiest way to migrate from Slate to Lexical, although it does come with a few caveats:\n- There is a performance hit when initializing the lexical editor\n- The editor will still output the Slate data in the output JSON, as the on-the-fly converter only runs for the admin panel\n\nThe easy way to solve this: Just save the document! This overrides the slate data with the lexical data, and the next time the document is loaded, the lexical data will be used. This solves both the performance and the output issue for that specific document.\n\n### Migration via migration script\n\nThe method described above does not solve the issue for all documents, though. If you want to convert all your documents to lexical, you can use a migration script. Here's a simple example:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Payload } from 'payload'\nimport type { YourDocumentType } from 'payload/generated-types'\n\nimport {\n  cloneDeep,\n  convertSlateToLexical,\n  defaultSlateConverters,\n} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nimport { AnotherCustomConverter } from './lexicalFeatures/converters/AnotherCustomConverter'\n\nexport async function convertAll(payload: Payload, collectionName: string, fieldName: string) {\n  const docs: YourDocumentType[] = await payload.db.collections[collectionName].find({}).exec() // Use MongoDB models directly to query all documents at once\n  console.log(`Found ${docs.length} ${collectionName} docs`)\n\n  const converters = cloneDeep([...defaultSlateConverters, AnotherCustomConverter])\n\n  // Split docs into batches of 20.\n  const batchSize = 20\n  const batches = []\n  for (let i = 0; i < docs.length; i += batchSize) {\n    batches.push(docs.slice(i, i + batchSize))\n  }\n\n  let processed = 0 // Number of processed docs\n\n  for (const batch of batches) {\n    // Process each batch asynchronously\n    const promises = batch.map(async (doc: YourDocumentType) => {\n      const richText = doc[fieldName]\n\n      if (richText && Array.isArray(richText) && !('root' in richText)) { // It's Slate data - skip already-converted data\n        const converted = convertSlateToLexical({\n          converters: converters,\n          slateData: richText,\n        })\n\n        await payload.update({\n          id: doc.id,\n          collection: collectionName as any,\n          data: {\n            [fieldName]: converted,\n          },\n        })\n      }\n    })\n\n    // Wait for all promises in the batch to complete. Resolving batches of 20 asynchronously is faster than waiting for each doc to update individually\n    await Promise.all(promises)\n\n    // Update the count of processed docs\n    processed += batch.length\n    console.log(`Converted ${processed} of ${docs.length}`)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `convertSlateToLexical` is the same method used in the `SlateToLexicalFeature` - it handles traversing the Slate JSON for you.\n\nDo note that this script might require adjustment depending on your document structure, especially if you have nested richText fields or localization enabled.\n\n### Converting custom Slate nodes\n\nIf you have custom Slate nodes, create a custom converter for them. Here's the Upload converter as an example:\n\n```ts\nimport type { SerializedUploadNode } from '../uploadNode.'\nimport type { SlateNodeConverter } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nexport const SlateUploadConverter: SlateNodeConverter = {\n  converter({ slateNode }) {\n    return {\n      fields: {\n        ...slateNode.fields,\n      },\n      format: '',\n      relationTo: slateNode.relationTo,\n      type: 'upload',\n      value: {\n        id: slateNode.value?.id || '',\n      },\n      version: 1,\n    } as const as SerializedUploadNode\n  },\n  nodeTypes: ['upload'],\n}\n```\n\nIt's pretty simple: You get a Slate node as input, and you return the lexical node. The `nodeTypes` array is used to determine which Slate nodes this converter can handle.\n\nWhen using a migration script, you can add your custom converters to the `converters` property of the `convertSlateToLexical` props, as seen in the example above\n\nWhen using the `SlateToLexicalFeature`, you can add your custom converters to the `converters` property of the `SlateToLexicalFeature` props:\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nimport {\n  SlateToLexicalFeature,\n  lexicalEditor,\n  defaultSlateConverters\n} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'\n\nimport { YourCustomConverter } from '../converters/YourCustomConverter'\n\nconst Pages: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'pages',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'nameOfYourRichTextField',\n      type: 'richText',\n      editor: lexicalEditor({\n        features: ({ defaultFeatures }) => [\n          ...defaultFeatures,\n          SlateToLexicalFeature({\n            converters: [\n              ...defaultSlateConverters,\n              YourCustomConverter\n            ]\n          }),\n        ],\n      }),\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n## Migrating from payload-plugin-lexical\n\nMigrating from [payload-plugin-lexical](https://github.com/AlessioGr/payload-plugin-lexical) works similar to migrating from Slate.\n\nInstead of a `SlateToLexicalFeature` there is a `LexicalPluginToLexicalFeature` you can use. And instead of `convertSlateToLexical` you can use `convertLexicalPluginToLexical`.\n\n## Coming Soon\n\nLots more documentation will be coming soon, which will show in detail how to create your own custom features within Lexical.\n\nFor now, take a look at the TypeScript interfaces and let us know if you need a hand. Much more will be coming from the Payload team on this topic soon.\n",

        "content": "\n**With Live Preview you can render your front-end application directly within the Admin panel. As you type, your changes take effect in real-time. No need to save a draft or publish your changes.**\n\nLive Preview works by rendering an iframe on the page that loads your front-end application. The Admin panel communicates with your app through [`window.postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) events. These events are emitted every time a change is made to the document. Your app then listens for these events and re-renders itself with the data it receives.\n\n{/* IMAGE OF LIVE PREVIEW HERE */}\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  Live Preview is currently in beta. You may use this feature in production, but please be aware that it is subject to change and may not be fully stable for all use cases. If you encounter any issues, please [report them](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues/new?assignees=jacobsfletch&labels=possible-bug&projects=&title=Live%20Preview&template=1.bug_report.yml) with as much detail as possible.\n</Banner>\n\n## Setup\n\nSetting up Live Preview is easy. You first need to enable it through the `admin.livePreview` property of your Payload config. It takes the following options:\n\n| Path                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`url`** \\*          | String, or function that returns a string, pointing to your front-end application. This value is used as the iframe `src`. [More details](#url).                                              |\n| **`breakpoints`**     | Array of breakpoints to be used as “device sizes” in the preview window. Each item appears as an option in the toolbar. [More details](#breakpoints).                                         |\n| **`collections`**     | Array of collection slugs to enable Live Preview on.                                                                                                                                          |\n| **`globals`**         | Array of global slugs to enable Live Preview on.                                                                                                                                              |\n\n_\\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._\n\nHere is a basic example of enabling Live Preview on a `pages` collection:\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    // ...\n    livePreview: {\n      url: 'http://localhost:3000', // The URL to your front-end, this can also be a function (see below)\n      collections: ['pages'], // The collections to enable Live Preview on (globals are also possible)\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can define the <code>admin.livePreview</code> property on individual collection and global configs. Settings defined here will be merged into the top-level as overrides (if applicable).\n\n```ts\n// Collection.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    // ...\n    livePreview: {\n      url: 'http://localhost:3000',\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOnce configured, a new \"Live Preview\" tab will appear at the top of enabled documents. Navigating to this tab opens the preview window and loads your front-end application.\n\n### URL\n\nThe `url` property is a string that points to your front-end application. This value is used as the `src` attribute of the iframe rendering your front-end.\n\nYou can also pass a function in order to dynamically format URLs. This function is called with the following arguments:\n\n| Path                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`data`**            | The data of the document being edited. This includes changes that have not yet been saved.                                                                                                  |\n| **`documentInfo`**    | Information about the document being edited like collection slug. [More details](../admin/hooks#usedocumentinfo).                                                                           |\n| **`locale`**          | The locale currently being edited (if applicable). [More details](../configuration/localization).                                                                         |\n\nHere is an example of using a function that returns a dynamic URL:\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    // ...\n    livePreview: {\n      url: ({\n        data,\n        documentInfo,\n        locale\n      }) => `${data.tenant.url}${ // Multi-tenant top-level domain\n        documentInfo.slug === 'posts' ? `/posts/${data.slug}` : `${data.slug !== 'home' : `/${data.slug}` : ''}`\n      }${locale ? `?locale=${locale?.code}` : ''}`, // Localization query param\n      collections: ['pages'],\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Breakpoints\n\nThe breakpoints property is an array of objects which are used as “device sizes” in the preview window. Each item will render as an option in the toolbar. When selected, the preview window will resize to the exact dimensions specified in that breakpoint. Each breakpoint takes the following properties:\n\n| Path                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`label`** \\*        | The label to display in the drop-down. This is what the user will see.                                                                                                                      |\n| **`name`** \\*         | The name of the breakpoint.                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| **`width`** \\*        | The width of the breakpoint. This is used to set the width of the iframe.                                                                                                                   |\n| **`height`** \\*       | The height of the breakpoint. This is used to set the height of the iframe.                                                                                                                 |\n\n_\\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._\n\nHere is an example of defining breakpoints:\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  admin: {\n    // ...\n    livePreview: {\n      url: 'http://localhost:3000',\n      breakpoints: [\n        {\n          label: 'Mobile',\n          name: 'mobile',\n          width: 375,\n          height: 667,\n        },\n        {\n          label: 'Tablet',\n          name: 'tablet',\n          width: 768,\n          height: 1024,\n        },\n        {\n          label: 'Desktop',\n          name: 'desktop',\n          width: 1440,\n          height: 900,\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\n{/* IMAGE OF TOOLBAR HERE */}\n\nThe \"Responsive\" option is always available in the drop-down and requires no additional configuration. This is the default breakpoint that will be used on initial load. This option styles the iframe with a width and height of `100%` so that it fills the screen at its maximum size and automatically resizes as the window changes size.\n\nYou may also explicitly resize the Live Preview by using the corresponding inputs in the toolbar. This will temporarily override the breakpoint selection to \"Custom\" until a predefined breakpoint is selected once again.\n\nIf you prefer to freely resize the Live Preview without the use of breakpoints, you can open it in a new window by clicking the button in the toolbar. This will close the iframe and open a new window which can be resized as you wish. Closing it will automatically re-open the iframe.\n\n## Example\n\nFor a working demonstration of this, check out the official [Live Preview Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/live-preview/payload).\n",

Your front-end application can listen for these events and re-render accordingly.\n\nWiring your front-end into Live Preview is easy. If your front-end application is built with React, Next.js, Vue or Nuxt.js, use the `useLivePreview` hook that Payload provides. In the future, all other major frameworks like Svelte will be officially supported. If you are using any of these frameworks today, you can still integrate with Live Preview yourself using the underlying tooling that Payload provides. See [building your own hook](#building-your-own-hook) for more information.\n\nBy default, all hooks accept the following args:\n\n| Path                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`serverURL`** \\*    | The URL of your Payload server.                                                                                                                                                             |\n| **`initialData`**     | The initial data of the document.

Defaults to `0`.                                                                                                                                   |\n| **`apiRoute`**        | The path of your API route as defined in `routes.api`. Defaults to `/api`.                                                                                                                              |\n\n_\\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._\n\nAnd return the following values:\n\n| Path                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`data`**            | The live data of the document, merged with the initial data.                                                                                                                                |\n| **`isLoading`**       | A boolean that indicates whether or not the document is loading.                                                                                                                            |\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  If your front-end is tightly coupled to required fields, you should ensure that your UI does not break when these fields are removed. For example, if you are rendering something like `data.relatedPosts[0].title`, your page will break once you remove the first related post. To get around this, use conditional logic, optional chaining, or default values in your UI where needed. For example, `data?.relatedPosts?.[0]?.title`.\n</Banner>\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  If is important that the `depth` argument matches exactly with the depth of your initial page request. The depth property is used to populated relationships and uploads beyond their IDs. See [Depth](../getting-started/concepts#depth) for more information.\n</Banner>\n\n### React\n\nIf your front-end application is built with React or Next.js, you can use the `useLivePreview` hook that Payload provides.\n\nFirst, install the `@payloadcms/live-preview-react` package:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @payloadcms/live-preview-react\n```\n\nThen, use the `useLivePreview` hook in your React component:\n\n```tsx\n'use client';\nimport { useLivePreview } from '@payloadcms/live-preview-react';\nimport { Page as PageType } from '@/payload-types'\n\n// Fetch the page in a server component, pass it to the client component, then thread it through the hook\n// The hook will take over from there and keep the preview in sync with the changes you make\n// The `data` property will contain the live data of the document\nexport const PageClient: React.FC<{\n  page: {\n    title: string\n  }\n}> = ({ page: initialPage }) => {\n  const { data } = useLivePreview<PageType>({\n    initialData: initialPage,\n    serverURL: PAYLOAD_SERVER_URL,\n    depth: 2,\n  })\n\n  return (\n    <h1>{data.title}</h1>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Vue\n\nIf your front-end application is built with Vue 3 or Nuxt 3, you can use the `useLivePreview` composable that Payload provides.\n\nFirst, install the `@payloadcms/live-preview-vue` package:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @payloadcms/live-preview-vue\n```\n\nThen, use the `useLivePreview` hook in your Vue component:\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport type { PageData } from '~/types';\nimport { defineProps } from 'vue';\nimport { useLivePreview } from '@payloadcms/live-preview-vue';\n\n// Fetch the initial data on the parent component or using async state\nconst props = defineProps<{ initialData: PageData }>();\n\n// The hook will take over from here and keep the preview in sync with the changes you make.\n// The `data` property will contain the live data of the document only when viewed from the Preview view of the Admin UI.\nconst { data } = useLivePreview<PageData>({\n  initialData: props.initialData,\n  serverURL: \"<PAYLOAD_SERVER_URL>\",\n  depth: 2,\n});\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <h1>{{ data.title }}</h1>\n</template>\n```\n\n## Building your own hook\n\nNo matter what front-end framework you are using, you can build your own hook using the same underlying tooling that Payload provides.\n\nFirst, install the base `@payloadcms/live-preview` package:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @payloadcms/live-preview\n```\n\nThis package provides the following functions:\n\n| Path                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`subscribe`**       | Subscribes to the Admin panel's `window.postMessage` events and calls the provided callback function.                                                                                       |\n| **`unsubscribe`**     | Unsubscribes from the Admin panel's `window.postMessage` events.                                                                                                                            |\n| **`ready`**           | Sends a `window.postMessage` event to the Admin panel to indicate that the front-end is ready to receive messages.                                                                          |\n\nThe `subscribe` function takes the following args:\n\n| Path                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`callback`** \\*     | A callback function that is called with `data` every time a change is made to the document.                                                                                                 |\n| **`serverURL`** \\*    | The URL of your Payload server.                                                                                                                                                             |\n| **`initialData`**     | The initial data of the document. The live data will be merged in as changes are made.                                                                                                      |\n| **`depth`**           | The depth of the relationships to fetch. Defaults to `0`.                                                                                                                                   |\n\nWith these functions, you can build your own hook using your front-end framework of choice:\n\n```tsx\nimport { subscribe, unsubscribe } from '@payloadcms/live-preview';\n\n// To build your own hook, subscribe to Live Preview events using the`subscribe` function\n// It handles everything from:\n// 1. Listening to `window.postMessage` events\n// 2. Merging initial data with active form state\n// 3. Populating relationships and uploads\n// 4. Calling the `onChange` callback with the result\n// Your hook should also:\n// 1. Tell the Admin panel when it is ready to receive messages\n// 2. Handle the results of the `onChange` callback to update the UI\n// 3. Unsubscribe from the `window.postMessage` events when it unmounts\n```\n\nHere is an example of what the same `useLivePreview` React hook from above looks like under the hood:\n\n```tsx\nimport { subscribe, unsubscribe, ready } from '@payloadcms/live-preview'\nimport { useCallback, useEffect, useState, useRef } from 'react'\n\nexport const useLivePreview = <T extends any>(props: {\n  depth?: number\n  initialData: T\n  serverURL: string\n}): {\n  data: T\n  isLoading: boolean\n} => {\n  const { depth = 0, initialData, serverURL } = props\n  const [data, setData] = useState<T>(initialData)\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState<boolean>(true)\n  const hasSentReadyMessage = useRef<boolean>(false)\n\n  const onChange = useCallback((mergedData) => {\n    // When a change is made, the `onChange` callback will be called with the merged data\n    // Set this merged data into state so that React will re-render the UI\n    setData(mergedData)\n    setIsLoading(false)\n  }, [])\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Listen for `window.postMessage` events from the Admin panel\n    // When a change is made, the `onChange` callback will be called with the merged data\n    const subscription = subscribe({\n      callback: onChange,\n      depth,\n      initialData,\n      serverURL,\n    })\n\n    // Once subscribed, send a `ready` message back up to the Admin panel\n    // This will indicate that the front-end is ready to receive messages\n    if (!hasSentReadyMessage.current) {\n      hasSentReadyMessage.current = true\n\n      ready({\n        serverURL\n      })\n    }\n\n    // When the component unmounts, unsubscribe from the `window.postMessage` events\n    return () => {\n      unsubscribe(subscription)\n    }\n  }, [serverURL, onChange, depth, initialData])\n\n  return {\n    data,\n    isLoading,\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  When building your own hook, ensure that the args and return values are consistent with the ones listed at the top of this document. This will ensure that all hooks follow the same API.\n</Banner>\n\n## Example\n\nFor a working demonstration of this, check out the official [Live Preview Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/live-preview/payload). There you will find examples of various front-end frameworks and how to integrate each one of them, including:\n\n- [Next.js App Router](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/live-preview/next-app)\n- [Next.js Pages Router](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/live-preview/next-pages)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n#### Relationships and/or uploads are not populating\n\nIf you are using relationships or uploads in your front-end application, and your front-end application runs on a different domain than your Payload server, you may need to configure [CORS](../configuration/overview) to allow requests to be made between the two domains. This includes sites that are running on a different port or subdomain. Similarly, if you are protecting resources behind user authentication, you may also need to configure [CSRF](../authentication/overview#csrf-protection) to allow cookies to be sent between the two domains. For example:\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  // If your site is running on a different domain than your Payload server,\n  // This will allows requests to be made between the two domains\n  cors: {\n    [\n      'http://localhost:3001' // Your front-end application\n    ],\n  },\n  // If you are protecting resources behind user authentication,\n  // This will allow cookies to be sent between the two domains\n  csrf: {\n    [\n      'http://localhost:3001' // Your front-end application\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n#### Relationships and/or uploads disappear after editing a document\n\nIt is possible that either you are setting an improper [`depth`](../getting-started/concepts#depth) in your initial request and/or your `useLivePreview` hook, or they're mismatched. Ensure that the `depth` parameter is set to the correct value, and that it matches exactly in both places. For example:\n\n```tsx\n// Your initial request\nconst { docs } = await payload.find({\n  collection: 'pages',\n  depth: 1, // Ensure this is set to the proper depth for your application\n  where: {\n    slug: {\n      equals: 'home',\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n```tsx\n// Your hook\nconst { data } = useLivePreview<PageType>({\n  initialData: initialPage,\n  serverURL: PAYLOAD_SERVER_URL,\n  depth: 1, // Ensure this matches the depth of your initial request\n})\n```\n\n#### Iframe refuses to connect\n\nIf your front-end application has set a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) (CSP) that blocks the Admin Panel from loading your front-end application, the iframe will not be able to load your site. To resolve this, you can whitelist the Admin Panel's domain in your CSP by setting the `frame-ancestors` directive:\n\n```plaintext\nframe-ancestors: \"self\" localhost:* https://your-site.com;\n```\n",

Declaring who should have access to what documents is no more complex than writing a simple JavaScript function that either returns a `boolean` or a [`query`](../queries/overview) constraint to restrict which documents users can interact with.\n\n<YouTube id=\"DoPLyXG26Dg\" title=\"Overview of Payload Access Control\" />\n\n**Example use cases:**\n\n- Allowing anyone `read` access to all `Post`s\n- Only allowing public access to `Post`s where a `status` field is equal to `published`\n- Giving only `User`s with a `role` field equal to `admin` the ability to delete `Page`(s)\n- Allowing anyone to create `ContactSubmission`s, but only logged in users to `read`, `update` or `delete` them\n- Restricting a `User` to only be able to see their own `Order`(s), but no others\n- Allowing `User`s that belong to a certain `Organization` to access only that `Organization`'s `Resource`s\n\n### Default Settings\n\n**By default, all Collections and Globals require that a user is logged in to be able to interact in any way.** The default Access Control function evaluates the `user` from the Express `req` and returns `true` if a user is logged in, and `false` if not.\n\n**Default Access function:**\n\n```ts\nconst defaultPayloadAccess = ({ req: { user } }) => {\n  // Return `true` if a user is found\n  // and `false` if it is undefined or null\n  return Boolean(user)\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  In the Local API, all Access Control functions are skipped by default, allowing your server to do\n  whatever it needs. But, you can opt back in by setting the option\n  {' '}\n  <strong>\n    overrideAccess\n  </strong>\n  {' '}\n  to <strong>false</strong>.\n</Banner>\n\n### Access Control Types\n\nYou can manage access within Payload on three different levels:\n\n- [Collections](../access-control/collections)\n- [Fields](../access-control/fields)\n- [Globals](../access-control/globals)\n\n### When Access Control is Executed\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  Access control functions are utilized in two places. It's important to understand how and when\n  your access control is executed.\n</Banner>\n\n#### As you execute operations\n\nWhen you perform Payload operations like `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete`, your access control functions will be executed before any changes or operations are completed.\n\n#### Within the Admin UI\n\nThe Payload Admin UI responds dynamically to the access control that you define. For example, if you restrict editing a `ExampleCollection` to only users that feature a `role` of `admin`, the Payload Admin UI will **hide** the `ExampleCollection` from the Admin UI entirely. This is super powerful and allows you to control who can do what with your Admin UI.\n\nTo accomplish this, Payload ships with an `Access` operation, which is executed when a user logs into the Admin UI. Payload will execute each one of your access control functions, across all collections, globals, and fields, at the top level and return a response that contains a reflection of what the currently authenticated user can do with your application.\n\n### Argument Availability\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong>\n  <br />\n  When your access control functions are executed via the <strong>access</strong> operation, the{' '}\n  <strong>id</strong> and <strong>data</strong> arguments will be <strong>undefined</strong>,\n  because Payload is executing your functions without referencing a specific document.\n</Banner>\n\nIf you use `id` or `data` within your access control functions, make sure to check that they are defined first. If they are not, then you can assume that your access control is being executed via the `access` operation, to determine solely what the user can do within the Admin UI.\n",

This can be helpful to restrict users' access to only certain documents however you specify.\n\n**Available argument properties:**\n\n| Option    | Description                                                                |\n| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`req`** | The Express `request` object containing the currently authenticated `user` |\n| **`id`**  | `id` of document requested, if within `findByID`                           |\n\n**Example:**\n\n```ts\nimport { Access } from 'payload/config'\n\nconst canReadPage: Access = ({ req: { user } }) => {\n  // allow authenticated users\n  if (user) {\n    return true\n  }\n  // using a query constraint, guest users can access when a field named 'isPublic' is set to true\n  return {\n    // assumes we have a checkbox field named 'isPublic'\n    isPublic: {\n      equals: true,\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Update\n\nUpdate access functions can return a boolean result or optionally return a [query constraint](../queries/overview) to limit the document(s) that can be updated by the currently authenticated user. For example, returning a `query` from the `update` Access Control is helpful in cases where you would like to restrict a user to only being able to update the documents containing a `createdBy` relationship field equal to the user's ID.\n\n**Available argument properties:**\n\n| Option     | Description                                                                |\n| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`req`**  | The Express `request` object containing the currently authenticated `user` |\n| **`id`**   | `id` of document requested to update                                       |\n| **`data`** | The data passed to update the document with                                |\n\n**Example:**\n\n```ts\nimport { Access } from 'payload/config'\n\nconst canUpdateUser: Access = ({ req: { user }, id }) => {\n  // allow users with a role of 'admin'\n  if (user.roles && user.roles.some((role) => role === 'admin')) {\n    return true\n  }\n  // allow any other users to update only oneself\n  return user.id === id\n}\n```\n\n### Delete\n\nSimilarly to the Update function, returns a boolean or a [query constraint](../queries/overview) to limit which documents can be deleted by which users.\n\n**Available argument properties:**\n\n| Option    | Description                                                                                         |\n| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`req`** | The Express `request` object with additional `user` property, which is the currently logged in user |\n| **`id`**  | `id` of document requested to delete                                                                |\n\n**Example:**\n\n```ts\nimport { Access } from 'payload/config'\n\nconst canDeleteCustomer: Access = async ({ req, id }) => {\n  if (!id) {\n    // allow the admin UI to show controls to delete since it is indeterminate without the id\n    return true\n  }\n  // query another collection using the id\n  const result = await req.payload.find({\n    collection: 'contracts',\n    limit: 0,\n    depth: 0,\n    where: {\n      customer: { equals: id },\n    },\n  })\n\n  return result.totalDocs === 0\n}\n```\n\n### Admin\n\nIf the Collection is [used to access the Payload Admin panel](../admin/overview#the-admin-user-collection), the `Admin` Access Control function determines whether or not the currently logged in user can access the admin UI.\n\n**Available argument properties:**\n\n| Option    | Description                                                                |\n| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`req`** | The Express `request` object containing the currently authenticated `user` |\n\n### Unlock\n\nDetermines which users can [unlock](../authentication/operations#unlock) other users who may be blocked from authenticating successfully due to [failing too many login attempts](../authentication/config#options).\n\n**Available argument properties:**\n\n| Option    | Description                                                                |\n| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`req`** | The Express `request` object containing the currently authenticated `user` |\n",

If the Hook should modify data before a document is updated or created, and it relies on asynchronous actions such as fetching data from a third party, it might make sense to define your Hook as an asynchronous function, so you can be sure that your Hook completes before the operation's lifecycle continues. Async hooks are run in series - so if you have two async hooks defined, the second hook will wait for the first to complete before it starts.\n\nIf your Hook simply performs a side-effect, such as updating a CRM, it might be okay to define it synchronously, so the Payload operation does not have to wait for your hook to complete.\n\n#### Server-only execution\n\nPayload Hooks are only triggered on the server. You can safely [remove your hooks](../admin/excluding-server-code#aliasing-server-only-modules) from your Admin panel's client-side code by customizing the Webpack config, which not only keeps your Admin bundles' filesize small but also ensures that any server-side only code does not cause problems within browser environments.\n\n## Hook Types\n\nYou can specify hooks in the following contexts:\n\n- [Collection Hooks](../hooks/collections)\n- [Field Hooks](../hooks/fields)\n- [Global Hooks](../hooks/globals)\n",

This hook allows you to add or format data before the incoming data is validated server-side.\n\nPlease do note that this does not run before the client-side validation. If you added a `validate` function, this would be the lifecycle:\n\n1. `validate` runs on the client\n2. if successful, `beforeValidate` runs on the server\n3. `validate` runs on the server\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionBeforeValidateHook } from 'payload/types'\n\nconst beforeValidateHook: CollectionBeforeValidateHook = async ({\n  data, // incoming data to update or create with\n  req, // full express request\n  operation, // name of the operation ie. 'create', 'update'\n  originalDoc, // original document\n}) => {\n  return data // Return data to either create or update a document with\n}\n```\n\n### beforeChange\n\nImmediately following validation, `beforeChange` hooks will run within `create` and `update` operations. At this stage, you can be confident that the data that will be saved to the document is valid in accordance to your field validations. You can optionally modify the shape of data to be saved.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionBeforeChangeHook } from 'payload/types'\n\nconst beforeChangeHook: CollectionBeforeChangeHook = async ({\n  data, // incoming data to update or create with\n  req, // full express request\n  operation, // name of the operation ie. 'create', 'update'\n  originalDoc, // original document\n}) => {\n  return data // Return data to either create or update a document with\n}\n```\n\n### afterChange\n\nAfter a document is created or updated, the `afterChange` hook runs. This hook is helpful to recalculate statistics such as total sales within a global, syncing user profile changes to a CRM, and more.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionAfterChangeHook } from 'payload/types'\n\nconst afterChangeHook: CollectionAfterChangeHook = async ({\n  doc, // full document data\n  req, // full express request\n  previousDoc, // document data before updating the collection\n  operation, // name of the operation ie. 'create', 'update'\n}) => {\n  return doc\n}\n```\n\n### beforeRead\n\nRuns before `find` and `findByID` operations are transformed for output by `afterRead`. This hook fires before hidden fields are removed and before localized fields are flattened into the requested locale. Using this Hook will provide you with all locales and all hidden fields via the `doc` argument.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionBeforeReadHook } from 'payload/types'\n\nconst beforeReadHook: CollectionBeforeReadHook = async ({\n  doc, // full document data\n  req, // full express request\n  query, // JSON formatted query\n}) => {\n  return doc\n}\n```\n\n### afterRead\n\nRuns as the last step before documents are returned. Flattens locales, hides protected fields, and removes fields that users do not have access to.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionAfterReadHook } from 'payload/types'\n\nconst afterReadHook: CollectionAfterReadHook = async ({\n  doc, // full document data\n  req, // full express request\n  query, // JSON formatted query\n  findMany, // boolean to denote if this hook is running against finding one, or finding many\n}) => {\n  return doc\n}\n```\n\n### beforeDelete\n\nRuns before the `delete` operation. Returned values are discarded.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionBeforeDeleteHook } from 'payload/types';\n\nconst beforeDeleteHook: CollectionBeforeDeleteHook = async ({\n  req, // full express request\n  id, // id of document to delete\n}) => {...}\n```\n\n### afterDelete\n\nRuns immediately after the `delete` operation removes records from the database. Returned values are discarded.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionAfterDeleteHook } from 'payload/types';\n\nconst afterDeleteHook: CollectionAfterDeleteHook = async ({\n  req, // full express request\n  id, // id of document to delete\n  doc, // deleted document\n}) => {...}\n```\n\n### afterOperation\n\nThe `afterOperation` hook can be used to modify the result of operations or execute side-effects that run after an operation has completed.\n\nAvailable Collection operations include `create`, `find`, `findByID`, `update`, `updateByID`, `delete`, `deleteByID`, `login`, `refresh`, and `forgotPassword`.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionAfterOperationHook } from 'payload/types'\n\nconst afterOperationHook: CollectionAfterOperationHook = async ({\n  args, // arguments passed into the operation\n  operation, // name of the operation\n  req, // full express request\n  result, // the result of the operation, before modifications\n}) => {\n  return result // return modified result as necessary\n}\n```\n\n### beforeLogin\n\nFor auth-enabled Collections, this hook runs during `login` operations where a user with the provided credentials exist, but before a token is generated and added to the response. You can optionally modify the user that is returned, or throw an error in order to deny the login operation.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionBeforeLoginHook } from 'payload/types'\n\nconst beforeLoginHook: CollectionBeforeLoginHook = async ({\n  req, // full express request\n  user, // user being logged in\n}) => {\n  return user\n}\n```\n\n### afterLogin\n\nFor auth-enabled Collections, this hook runs after successful `login` operations. You can optionally modify the user that is returned.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionAfterLoginHook } from 'payload/types';\n\nconst afterLoginHook: CollectionAfterLoginHook = async ({\n  req, // full express request\n  user, // user that was logged in\n  token, // user token\n}) => {...}\n```\n\n### afterLogout\n\nFor auth-enabled Collections, this hook runs after `logout` operations.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionAfterLogoutHook } from 'payload/types';\n\nconst afterLogoutHook: CollectionAfterLogoutHook = async ({\n  req, // full express request\n}) => {...}\n```\n\n### afterRefresh\n\nFor auth-enabled Collections, this hook runs after `refresh` operations.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionAfterRefreshHook } from 'payload/types';\n\nconst afterRefreshHook: CollectionAfterRefreshHook = async ({\n  req, // full express request\n  res, // full express response\n  token, // newly refreshed user token\n}) => {...}\n```\n\n### afterMe\n\nFor auth-enabled Collections, this hook runs after `me` operations.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionAfterMeHook } from 'payload/types';\n\nconst afterMeHook: CollectionAfterMeHook = async ({\n  req, // full express request\n  response, // response to return\n}) => {...}\n```\n\n### afterForgotPassword\n\nFor auth-enabled Collections, this hook runs after successful `forgotPassword` operations. Returned values are discarded.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionAfterForgotPasswordHook } from 'payload/types'\n\nconst afterForgotPasswordHook: CollectionAfterForgotPasswordHook = async ({\n  args, // arguments passed into the operation\n  context, \n  collection, // The collection which this hook is being run on\n}) => {...}\n```\n\n### refresh\n\nFor auth-enabled Collections, this hook allows you to optionally replace the default behavior of the `refresh` operation with your own. If you optionally return a value from your hook, the operation will not perform its own logic and continue.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionRefreshHook } from 'payload/types'\n\nconst myRefreshHook: CollectionRefreshHook = async ({\n  args, // arguments passed into the `refresh` operation\n  user, // the user as queried from the database \n}) => {...}\n```\n\n### me\n\nFor auth-enabled Collections, this hook allows you to optionally replace the default behavior of the `me` operation with your own. If you optionally return a value from your hook, the operation will not perform its own logic and continue.\n\n```ts\nimport type { CollectionMeHook } from 'payload/types'\n\nconst meHook: CollectionMeHook = async ({\n  args, // arguments passed into the `me` operation\n  user, // the user as queried from the database \n}) => {...}\n```\n\n## TypeScript\n\nPayload exports a type for each Collection hook which can be accessed as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport type {\n  CollectionBeforeOperationHook,\n  CollectionBeforeValidateHook,\n  CollectionBeforeChangeHook,\n  CollectionAfterChangeHook,\n  CollectionAfterReadHook,\n  CollectionBeforeReadHook,\n  CollectionBeforeDeleteHook,\n  CollectionAfterDeleteHook,\n  CollectionBeforeLoginHook,\n  CollectionAfterLoginHook,\n  CollectionAfterLogoutHook,\n  CollectionAfterRefreshHook,\n  CollectionAfterMeHook,\n  CollectionAfterForgotPasswordHook,\n  CollectionRefreshHook,\n  CollectionMeHook,\n} from 'payload/types'\n```\n",

They help to isolate concerns and package up\nfunctionalities to be easily reusable across your projects.\n\n**Example use cases include:**\n\n- Automatically add an `owner` relationship to a Document based on the `req.user.id`\n- Encrypt / decrypt a sensitive field using `beforeValidate` and `afterRead` hooks\n- Auto-generate field data using a `beforeValidate` hook\n- Format incoming data such as kebab-casing a document `slug` with `beforeValidate`\n- Restrict updating a document to only once every X hours using the `beforeChange` hook\n\n**All field types provide the following hooks:**\n\n- [beforeValidate](#beforevalidate)\n- [beforeChange](#beforechange)\n- [afterChange](#afterchange)\n- [afterRead](#afterread)\n\n## Config\n\nExample field configuration:\n\n```ts\nimport { Field } from 'payload/types';\n\nconst ExampleField: Field = {\n  name: 'name',\n  type: 'text',\n  // highlight-start\n  hooks: {\n    beforeValidate: [(args) => {...}],\n    beforeChange: [(args) => {...}],\n    afterChange: [(args) => {...}],\n    afterRead: [(args) => {...}],\n  }\n  // highlight-end\n}\n```\n\n## Arguments and return values\n\nAll field-level hooks are formatted to accept the same arguments, although some arguments may be `undefined` based on\nwhich field hook you are utilizing.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  <br />\n  It's a good idea to conditionally scope your logic based on which operation is executing. For\n  example, if you are writing a <strong>beforeChange</strong> hook, you may want to perform\n  different logic based on if the current <strong>operation</strong> is <strong>create</strong> or{' '}\n  <strong>update</strong>.\n</Banner>\n\n#### Arguments\n\nField Hooks receive one `args` argument that contains the following properties:\n\n| Option                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **`data`**               | The data passed to update the document within `create` and `update` operations, and the full document itself in the `afterRead` hook.                                                                                 |\n| **`siblingData`**        | The sibling data passed to a field that the hook is running against.                                                                                                                                                  |\n| **`findMany`**           | Boolean to denote if this hook is running against finding one, or finding many within the `afterRead` hook.                                                                                                           |\n| **`operation`**          | A string relating to which operation the field type is currently executing within.

Field Hooks may\noptionally return the value that should be used within the field.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important</strong>\n  <br />\n  Due to GraphQL's typed nature, you should never change the type of data that you return from a\n  field, otherwise GraphQL will produce errors. If you need to change the shape or type of data,\n  reconsider Field Hooks and instead evaluate if Collection / Global hooks might suit you better.\n</Banner>\n\n## Examples of Field Hooks\n\nTo better illustrate how field-level hooks can be applied, here are some specific examples. These demonstrate the\nflexibility and potential of field hooks in different contexts. Remember, these examples are just a starting point - the\ntrue potential of field-level hooks lies in their adaptability to a wide array of use cases.\n\n### beforeValidate\n\nRuns before the `update` operation. This hook allows you to pre-process or format field data before it undergoes\nvalidation.\n\n```ts\nimport { Field } from 'payload/types'\n\nconst usernameField: Field = {\n  name: 'username',\n  type: 'text',\n  hooks: {\n    beforeValidate: [({ value }) => {\n      // Trim whitespace and convert to lowercase\n      return value.trim().toLowerCase()\n    }],\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `beforeValidate` hook is used to process the `username` field. The hook takes the incoming value of\nthe field and transforms it by trimming whitespace and converting it to lowercase. This ensures that the username is\nstored in a consistent format in the database.\n\n### beforeChange\n\nImmediately following validation, `beforeChange` hooks will run within `create` and `update` operations. At this stage,\nyou can be confident that the field data that will be saved to the document is valid in accordance to your field\nvalidations.\n\n```ts\nimport { Field } from 'payload/types'\n\nconst emailField: Field = {\n  name: 'email',\n  type: 'email',\n  hooks: {\n    beforeChange: [({ value, operation }) => {\n      if (operation === 'create') {\n        // Perform additional validation or transformation for 'create' operation\n      }\n      return value\n    }],\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the `emailField`, the `beforeChange` hook checks the `operation` type. If the operation is `create`, it performs\nadditional validation or transformation on the email field value. This allows for operation-specific logic to be applied\nto the field.\n\n### afterChange\n\nThe `afterChange` hook is executed after a field's value has been changed and saved in the database. This hook is useful\nfor post-processing or triggering side effects based on the new value of the field.\n\n```ts\nimport { Field } from 'payload/types'\n\nconst membershipStatusField: Field = {\n  name: 'membershipStatus',\n  type: 'select',\n  options: [\n    { label: 'Standard', value: 'standard' },\n    { label: 'Premium', value: 'premium' },\n    { label: 'VIP', value: 'vip' }\n  ],\n  hooks: {\n    afterChange: [({ value, previousValue, req }) => {\n      if (value !== previousValue) {\n        // Log or perform an action when the membership status changes\n        console.log(`User ID ${req.user.id} changed their membership status from ${previousValue} to ${value}.`)\n        // Here, you can implement actions that could track conversions from one tier to another\n      }\n    }],\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `afterChange` hook is used with a `membershipStatusField`, which allows users to select their\nmembership level (Standard, Premium, VIP). The hook monitors changes in the membership status. When a change occurs, it\nlogs the update and can be used to trigger further actions, such as tracking conversion from one tier to another or\nnotifying them about changes in their membership benefits.\n\n### afterRead\n\nThe `afterRead` hook is invoked after a field value is read from the database. This is ideal for formatting or\ntransforming the field data for output.\n\n```ts\nimport { Field } from 'payload/types'\n\nconst dateField: Field = {\n  name: 'createdAt',\n  type: 'date',\n  hooks: {\n    afterRead: [({ value }) => {\n      // Format date for display\n      return new Date(value).toLocaleDateString()\n    }],\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere, the `afterRead` hook for the `dateField` is used to format the date into a more readable format\nusing `toLocaleDateString()`. This hook modifies the way the date is presented to the user, making it more\nuser-friendly.\n\n## TypeScript\n\nPayload exports a type for field hooks which can be accessed and used as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport type { FieldHook } from 'payload/types'\n\n// Field hook type is a generic that takes three arguments:\n// 1: The document type\n// 2: The value type\n// 3: The sibling data type\n\ntype ExampleFieldHook = FieldHook<ExampleDocumentType, string, SiblingDataType>\n\nconst exampleFieldHook: ExampleFieldHook = (args) => {\n  const {\n    value, // Typed as `string` as shown above\n    data, // Typed as a Partial of your ExampleDocumentType\n    siblingData, // Typed as a Partial of SiblingDataType\n    originalDoc, // Typed as ExampleDocumentType\n    operation,\n    req,\n  } = args\n\n  // Do something here...\n\n  return value // should return a string as typed above, undefined, or null\n}\n```\n",

        "content": "\nThe `context` object in hooks is used to share data across different hooks. The persists throughout the entire lifecycle of a request and is available within every hook. This allows you to add logic to your hooks based on the request state by setting properties to `req.context` and using them elsewhere.\n\n## When to use Context\n\nContext gives you a way forward on otherwise difficult problems such as:\n\n1. **Passing data between hooks**: Needing data in multiple hooks from a 3rd party API, it could be retrieved and used in `beforeChange` and later used again in an `afterChange` hook without having to fetch it twice.\n2. **Preventing infinite loops**: Calling `payload.update()` on the same document that triggered an `afterChange` hook will create an infinite loop, control the flow by assigning a no-op condition to context\n3. **Passing data to local API**: Setting values on the `req.context` and pass it to `payload.create()` you can provide additional data to hooks without adding extraneous fields.\n4. **Passing data between hooks and middleware or custom endpoints**: Hooks could set context across multiple collections and then be used in a final `postMiddleware`.\n\n## How to Use Context\n\nLet's see examples on how context can be used in the first two scenarios mentioned above:\n\n### Passing data between hooks\n\nTo pass data between hooks, you can assign values to context in an earlier hook in the lifecycle of a request and expect it the context in a later hook.\n\nFor example:\n\n```ts\nconst Customer: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'customers',\n  hooks: {\n    beforeChange: [\n      async ({ context, data }) => {\n        // assign the customerData to context for use later\n        context.customerData = await fetchCustomerData(data.customerID)\n        return {\n          ...data,\n          // some data we use here\n          name: context.customerData.name,\n        }\n      },\n    ],\n    afterChange: [\n      async ({ context, doc, req }) => {\n        // use context.customerData without needing to fetch it again\n        if (context.customerData.contacted === false) {\n          createTodo('Call Customer', context.customerData)\n        }\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  fields: [\n    /* ... */\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n### Preventing infinite loops\n\nLet's say you have an `afterChange` hook, and you want to do a calculation inside the hook (as the document ID needed for the calculation is available in the `afterChange` hook, but not in the `beforeChange` hook). Once that's done, you want to update the document with the result of the calculation.\n\nBad example:\n\n```ts\nconst Customer: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'customers',\n  hooks: {\n    afterChange: [\n      async ({ doc }) => {\n        await payload.update({\n          // DANGER: updating the same slug as the collection in an afterChange will create an infinite loop!\n          collection: 'customers',\n          id: doc.id,\n          data: {\n            ...(await fetchCustomerData(data.customerID)),\n          },\n        })\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  fields: [\n    /* ... */\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nInstead of the above, we need to tell the `afterChange` hook to not run again if it performs the update (and thus not update itself again). We can solve that with context.\n\nFixed example:\n\n```ts\nconst MyCollection: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'slug',\n  hooks: {\n    afterChange: [\n      async ({ context, doc }) => {\n        // return if flag was previously set\n        if (context.triggerAfterChange === false) {\n          return\n        }\n        await payload.update({\n          collection: contextHooksSlug,\n          id: doc.id,\n          data: {\n            ...(await fetchCustomerData(data.customerID)),\n          },\n          context: {\n            // set a flag to prevent from running again\n            triggerAfterChange: false,\n          },\n        })\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  fields: [\n    /* ... */\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n## Typing context\n\nThe default typescript interface for `context` is `{ [key: string]: unknown }`. If you prefer a more strict typing in your project or when authoring plugins for others, you can override this using the `declare` syntax.\n\nThis is known as \"type augmentation\" - a TypeScript feature which allows us to add types to existing objects. Simply put this in any .ts or .d.ts file:\n\n```ts\nimport { RequestContext as OriginalRequestContext } from 'payload'\n\ndeclare module 'payload' {\n  // Create a new interface that merges your additional fields with the original one\n  export interface RequestContext extends OriginalRequestContext {\n    myObject?: string\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis will add a the property `myObject` with a type of string to every context object. Make sure to follow this example correctly, as type augmentation can mess up your types if you do it wrong.\n",

But, you can add support to one or many Collections of your own. For more information on how to customize, override, or remove the default `User` collection, [click here](../admin/overview#the-admin-user-collection).\n\n### Enabling Auth on a collection\n\nEvery Payload Collection can opt-in to supporting Authentication by specifying the `auth` property on the Collection's config to either `true` or to an object containing `auth` options.\n\n**For a full list of all `auth` options, [click here](../authentication/config).**\n\nSimple example collection:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Admins: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'admins',\n  // highlight-start\n  auth: {\n    tokenExpiration: 7200, // How many seconds to keep the user logged in\n    verify: true, // Require email verification before being allowed to authenticate\n    maxLoginAttempts: 5, // Automatically lock a user out after X amount of failed logins\n    lockTime: 600 * 1000, // Time period to allow the max login attempts\n    // More options are available\n  },\n  // highlight-end\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'role',\n      type: 'select',\n      required: true,\n      options: [\n        'user',\n        'admin',\n        'editor',\n        'developer',\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n**By enabling Authentication on a config, the following modifications will automatically be made to your Collection:**\n\n1. `email` as well as password `salt` & `hash` fields will be added to your Collection's schema\n1. The Admin panel will feature a new set of corresponding UI to allow for changing password and editing email\n1. [A new set of `operations`](../authentication/operations) will be exposed via Payload's REST, Local, and GraphQL APIs\n\nOnce enabled, each document that is created within the Collection can be thought of as a `user` - who can make use of commonly required authentication functions such as logging in / out, resetting their password, and more.\n\n### Logging in / out, resetting password, etc.\n\n[Click here](../authentication/operations) for a list of all automatically-enabled Auth operations, including `login`, `logout`, `refresh`, and others.\n\n### Token-based auth\n\nSuccessfully logging in returns a `JWT` (JSON web token) which is how a user will identify themselves to Payload. By providing this JWT via either an HTTP-only cookie or an `Authorization: JWT` or `Authorization: Bearer` header, Payload will automatically identify the user and add its user JWT data to the Express `req`, which is available throughout Payload including within access control, hooks, and more.\n\nYou can specify what data gets encoded to the JWT token by setting `saveToJWT` to true in your auth collection fields. If you wish to use a different key other than the field `name`, you can provide it to `saveToJWT` as a string. It is also possible to use `saveToJWT` on fields that are nested in inside groups and tabs. If a group has a `saveToJWT` set it will include the object with all sub-fields in the token. You can set `saveToJWT: false` for any fields you wish to omit. If a field inside a group has `saveToJWT` set, but the group does not, the field will be included at the top level of the token.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  <br />\n  You can access the logged-in user from access control functions and hooks via the Express{' '}\n  <strong>req</strong>. The logged-in user is automatically added as the <strong>user</strong>{' '}\n  property.\n</Banner>\n\n### HTTP-only cookies\n\nPayload `login`, `logout`, and `refresh` operations make use of HTTP-only cookies for authentication purposes. HTTP-only cookies are a highly secure method of storing identifiable data on a user's device so that Payload can automatically recognize a returning user until their cookie expires. They are totally protected from common XSS attacks and cannot be read at all via JavaScript in the browser.\n\n##### Automatic browser inclusion\n\nModern browsers automatically include `http-only` cookies when making requests directly to URLs—meaning that if you are running your API on http://example.com, and you have logged in and visit http://example.com/test-page, your browser will automatically include the Payload authentication cookie for you.\n\n##### Using Fetch or other HTTP APIs\n\nHowever, if you use `fetch` or similar APIs to retrieve Payload resources from its REST or GraphQL API, you need to specify to include credentials (cookies).\n\nFetch example, including credentials:\n\n```ts\nconst response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/pages', {\n  credentials: 'include',\n})\n\nconst pages = await response.json()\n```\n\nFor more about how to automatically include cookies in requests from your app to your Payload API, [click here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#Sending_a_request_with_credentials_included).\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  <br />\n  To make sure you have a Payload cookie set properly in your browser after logging in, you can use\n  Chrome's Developer Tools - Application - Cookies - [your-domain-here]. The Chrome Developer tools\n  will still show HTTP-only cookies, even when JavaScript running on the page can't.\n</Banner>\n\n### CSRF Protection\n\nCSRF (cross-site request forgery) attacks are common and dangerous. By using an HTTP-only cookie, Payload removes many XSS vulnerabilities, however, CSRF attacks can still be possible.\n\nFor example, let's say you have a very popular app running at coolsite.com. This app allows users to manage finances and send / receive money. As Payload is using HTTP-only cookies, that means that browsers automatically will include cookies when sending requests to your domain - no matter what page created the request.\n\nSo, if a user of coolsite.com is logged in and just browsing around on the internet, they might stumble onto a page with bad intentions. That bad page might automatically make requests to all sorts of sites to see if they can find one that they can log into - and coolsite.com might be on their list. If your user was logged in while they visited that evil site, the attacker could do whatever they wanted as if they were your coolsite.com user by just sending requests to the coolsite API (which would automatically include the auth cookie). They could send themselves a bunch of money from your user's account, change the user's password, etc. This is what a CSRF attack is.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>\n    To protect against CSRF attacks, Payload only accepts cookie-based authentication from domains\n    that you explicitly whitelist.\n  </strong>\n</Banner>\n\nTo define domains that should allow users to identify themselves via the Payload HTTP-only cookie, use the `csrf` option on the base Payload config to whitelist domains that you trust.\n\n`payload.config.ts`:\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    // collections here\n  ],\n  // highlight-start\n  csrf: [\n    // whitelist of domains to allow cookie auth from\n    'https://your-frontend-app.com',\n    'https://your-other-frontend-app.com',\n  ],\n  // highlight-end\n})\n\nexport default config\n```\n\n### Identifying users via the Authorization Header\n\nIn addition to authenticating via an HTTP-only cookie, you can also identify users via the `Authorization` header on an HTTP request.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nconst request = await fetch('http://localhost:3000', {\n  headers: {\n    Authorization: `JWT ${token}`,\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can retrieve a user's token via the response to `login`, `refresh`, and `me` auth operations.\n",

Just like you can authenticate as a user with an email and password, which is considered as our default local auth strategy, you can also authenticate as a user with an API key. API keys are generated on a user-by-user basis, similar to email and passwords, and are meant to represent a single user.\n\nFor example, if you have a third-party service or external app that needs to be able to perform protected actions at its discretion, you have two options:\n\n1. Create a user for the third-party app, and log in each time to receive a token before you attempt to access any protected actions\n1. Enable API key support for the Collection, where you can generate a non-expiring API key per user in the collection. This is particularly useful as you can create a \"user\" that reflects an integration with a specific external service and assign a \"role\" or specific access only needed by that service/integration. Alternatively, you could create a \"super admin\" user and assign an API key to that user so that any requests made with that API key are considered as being made by that super user.\n\nTechnically, both of these options will work for third-party integrations but the second option with API key is simpler, because it reduces the amount of work that your integrations need to do to be authenticated properly.\n\nTo enable API keys on a collection, set the `useAPIKey` auth option to `true`. From there, a new interface will appear in the Admin panel for each document within the collection that allows you to generate an API key for each user in the Collection.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  User API keys are encrypted within the database, meaning that if your database is compromised,\n  your API keys will not be.\n</Banner>\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong>\n  If you change your `PAYLOAD_SECRET`, you will need to regenerate your API keys.\n  <br />\n  The secret key is used to encrypt the API keys, so if you change the secret, existing API keys will no longer be valid.\n</Banner>\n\n#### Authenticating via API Key\n\nTo authenticate REST or GraphQL API requests using an API key, set the `Authorization` header. The header is case-sensitive and needs the slug of the `auth.useAPIKey` enabled collection, then \" API-Key \", followed by the `apiKey` that has been assigned. Payload's built-in middleware will then assign the user document to `req.user` and handle requests with the proper access control. By doing this, Payload recognizes the request being made as a request by the user associated with that API key.\n\n**For example, using Fetch:**\n\n```ts\nimport User from '../collections/User'\n\nconst response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/pages', {\n  headers: {\n    Authorization: `${User.slug} API-Key ${YOUR_API_KEY}`,\n  },\n})\n```\n\nPayload ensures that the same, uniform access control is used across all authentication strategies. This enables you to utilize your existing access control configurations with both API keys and the standard email/password authentication. This consistency can aid in maintaining granular control over your API keys.\n\n#### API Key _Only_ Authentication\n\nIf you want to use API keys as the only authentication method for a collection, you can disable the default local strategy by setting `disableLocalStrategy` to `true` on the collection's `auth` property. This will disable the ability to authenticate with email and password, and will only allow for authentication via API key.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Customers: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'customers',\n  auth: {\n    useAPIKey: true,\n    disableLocalStrategy: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Forgot Password\n\nYou can customize how the Forgot Password workflow operates with the following options on the `auth.forgotPassword` property:\n\n**`generateEmailHTML`**\n\nFunction that accepts one argument, containing `{ req, token, user }`, that allows for overriding the HTML within emails that are sent to users attempting to reset their password. The function should return a string that supports HTML, which can be a full HTML email.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  <br />\n  HTML templating can be used to create custom email templates, inline CSS automatically, and more.\n  You can make a reusable function that standardizes all email sent from Payload, which makes\n  sending custom emails more DRY. Payload doesn't ship with an HTML templating engine, so you are\n  free to choose your own.\n</Banner>\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Customers: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'customers',\n  auth: {\n    forgotPassword: {\n      // highlight-start\n      generateEmailHTML: ({ req, token, user }) => {\n        // Use the token provided to allow your user to reset their password\n        const resetPasswordURL = `https://yourfrontend.com/reset-password?token=${token}`\n\n        return `\n          <!doctype html>\n          <html>\n            <body>\n              <h1>Here is my custom email template!</h1>\n              <p>Hello, ${user.email}!</p>\n              <p>Click below to reset your password.</p>\n              <p>\n                <a href=\"${resetPasswordURL}\">${resetPasswordURL}</a>\n              </p>\n            </body>\n          </html>\n        `\n      },\n      // highlight-end\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If you specify a different URL to send your users to for resetting their password, such as a page\n  on the frontend of your app or similar, you need to handle making the call to the Payload REST or\n  GraphQL reset-password operation yourself on your frontend, using the token that was provided for\n  you. Above, it was passed via query parameter.\n</Banner>\n\n**`generateEmailSubject`**\n\nSimilarly to the above `generateEmailHTML`, you can also customize the subject of the email. The function argument are the same but you can only return a string - not HTML.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\n{\n  slug: 'customers',\n  auth: {\n    forgotPassword: {\n      // highlight-start\n      generateEmailSubject: ({ req, user }) => {\n        return `Hey ${user.email}, reset your password!`;\n      }\n      // highlight-end\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Email Verification\n\nIf you'd like to require email verification before a user can successfully log in, you can enable it by passing `true` or an `options` object to `auth.verify`. The following options are available:\n\n**`generateEmailHTML`**\n\nFunction that accepts one argument, containing `{ req, token, user }`, that allows for overriding the HTML within emails that are sent to users indicating how to validate their account. The function should return a string that supports HTML, which can optionally be a full HTML email.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Customers: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'customers',\n  auth: {\n    verify: {\n      // highlight-start\n      generateEmailHTML: ({ req, token, user }) => {\n        // Use the token provided to allow your user to verify their account\n        const url = `https://yourfrontend.com/verify?token=${token}`\n\n        return `Hey ${user.email}, verify your email by clicking here: ${url}`\n      },\n      // highlight-end\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If you specify a different URL to send your users to for email verification, such as a page on the\n  frontend of your app or similar, you need to handle making the call to the Payload REST or GraphQL\n  verification operation yourself on your frontend, using the token that was provided for you.\n  Above, it was passed via query parameter.\n</Banner>\n\n**`generateEmailSubject`**\n\nSimilarly to the above `generateEmailHTML`, you can also customize the subject of the email. The function argument are the same but you can only return a string - not HTML.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\n{\n  slug: 'customers',\n  auth: {\n    verify: {\n      // highlight-start\n      generateEmailSubject: ({ req, user }) => {\n        return `Hey ${user.email}, reset your password!`;\n      }\n      // highlight-end\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Strategies\n\nAs of Payload `1.0.0`, you can add additional authentication strategies to Payload easily by passing them to your collection's `auth.strategies` array.\n\nBehind the scenes, Payload uses PassportJS to power its local authentication strategy, so most strategies listed on the PassportJS website will work seamlessly. Combined with adding custom components to the admin panel's `Login` view, you can create advanced authentication strategies directly within Payload.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  This is an advanced feature, so only attempt this if you are an experienced developer. Otherwise,\n  just let Payload's built-in authentication handle user auth for you.\n</Banner>\n\nThe `strategies` property is an array that takes objects with the following properties:\n\n**`strategy`**\n\nThis property can accept a Passport strategy directly, or you can pass a function that takes a `payload` argument, and returns a Passport strategy.\n\n**`name`**\n\nIf you pass a strategy to the `strategy` property directly, the `name` property is optional and allows you to override the strategy's built-in name.\n\nHowever, if you pass a function to `strategy`, `name` is a required property.\n\nIn either case, Payload will prefix the strategy name with the collection `slug` that the strategy is passed to.\n\n### Admin autologin\n\nFor testing and demo purposes you may want to skip forcing the admin user to login in order to access the panel.\nThe `admin.autologin` property is used to configure the how visitors are handled when accessing the admin panel.\nThe default is that all users will have to login and this should not be enabled for environments where data needs to protected.\n\n#### autoLogin Options\n\n| Option            | Description                                                                                                     |\n| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`email`**       | The email address of the user to login as                                                                       |\n| **`password`**    | The password of the user to login as                                                                            |\n| **`prefillOnly`** | If set to true, the login credentials will be prefilled but the user will still need to click the login button. |\n\nThe recommended way to use this feature is behind an environment variable to ensure it is disabled when in production.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```ts\nexport default buildConfig({\n  admin: {\n    user: 'users',\n    // highlight-start\n    autoLogin:\n      process.env.PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AUTOLOGIN === 'true'\n        ? {\n            email: 'test@example.com',\n            password: 'test',\n            prefillOnly: true,\n          }\n        : false,\n    // highlight-end\n  },\n  collections: [\n    /** */\n  ],\n})\n```\n",

If you pass an Express `res` to the Local API operation, Payload will set a cookie there as well.\n\n**Example REST API login**:\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/[collection-slug]/login', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n    password: 'this-is-not-our-password...or-is-it?',\n  }),\n})\n\nconst json = await res.json()\n\n// JSON will be equal to the following:\n/*\n{\n  user: {\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n    createdAt: \"2020-12-27T21:16:45.645Z\",\n    updatedAt: \"2021-01-02T18:37:41.588Z\",\n    id: \"5ae8f9bde69e394e717c8832\"\n  },\n  token: '34o4345324...',\n  exp: 1609619861\n}\n*/\n```\n\n**Example GraphQL Mutation**:\n\n```graphql\nmutation {\n  login[collection-singular-label](email: \"dev@payloadcms.com\", password: \"yikes\") {\n    user {\n      email\n    }\n    exp\n    token\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Example Local API login**:\n\n```ts\nconst result = await payload.login({\n  collection: '[collection-slug]',\n  data: {\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n    password: 'get-out',\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Logout\n\nAs Payload sets HTTP-only cookies, logging out cannot be done by just removing a cookie in JavaScript, as HTTP-only cookies are inaccessible by JS within the browser. So, Payload exposes a `logout` operation to delete the token in a safe way.\n\n**Example REST API logout**:\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/[collection-slug]/logout', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  },\n})\n```\n\n**Example GraphQL Mutation**:\n\n```\nmutation {\n  logout[collection-singular-label]\n}\n```\n\n### Refresh\n\nAllows for \"refreshing\" JWTs. If your user has a token that is about to expire, but the user is still active and using the app, you might want to use the `refresh` operation to receive a new token by executing this operation via the authenticated user.\n\nThis operation requires a non-expired token to send back a new one. If the user's token has already expired, you will need to allow them to log in again to retrieve a new token.\n\nIf successful, this operation will automatically renew the user's HTTP-only cookie and will send back the updated token in JSON.\n\n**Example REST API token refresh**:\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/[collection-slug]/refresh-token', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  },\n})\n\nconst json = await res.json()\n\n// JSON will be equal to the following:\n/*\n{\n  user: {\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n    createdAt: \"2020-12-27T21:16:45.645Z\",\n    updatedAt: \"2021-01-02T18:37:41.588Z\",\n    id: \"5ae8f9bde69e394e717c8832\"\n  },\n  refreshedToken: '34o4345324...',\n  exp: 1609619861\n}\n*/\n```\n\n**Example GraphQL Mutation**:\n\n```\nmutation {\n  refreshToken[collection-singular-label] {\n    user {\n      email\n    }\n    refreshedToken\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Verify by Email\n\nIf your collection supports email verification, the Verify operation will be exposed which accepts a verification token and sets the user's `_verified` property to `true`, thereby allowing the user to authenticate with the Payload API.\n\n**Example REST API user verification**:\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/[collection-slug]/verify/${TOKEN_HERE}`, {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  },\n})\n```\n\n**Example GraphQL Mutation**:\n\n```graphql\nmutation {\n  verifyEmail[collection-singular-label](token: \"TOKEN_HERE\")\n}\n```\n\n**Example Local API verification**:\n\n```ts\nconst result = await payload.verifyEmail({\n  collection: '[collection-slug]',\n  token: 'TOKEN_HERE',\n})\n```\n\n### Unlock\n\nIf a user locks themselves out and you wish to deliberately unlock them, you can utilize the Unlock operation. The Admin panel features an Unlock control automatically for all collections that feature max login attempts, but you can programmatically unlock users as well by using the Unlock operation.\n\nTo restrict who is allowed to unlock users, you can utilize the [`unlock`](../access-control/overview#unlock) access control function.\n\n**Example REST API unlock**:\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/[collection-slug]/unlock`, {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n  }),\n})\n```\n\n**Example GraphQL Mutation**:\n\n```\nmutation {\n  unlock[collection-singular-label](email: \"dev@payloadcms.com\")\n}\n```\n\n**Example Local API unlock**:\n\n```ts\nconst result = await payload.unlock({\n  collection: '[collection-slug]',\n  data: {\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Forgot Password\n\nPayload comes with built-in forgot password functionality. Submitting an email address to the Forgot Password operation will generate an email and send it to the respective email address with a link to reset their password.\n\nThe link to reset the user's password contains a token which is what allows the user to securely reset their password.\n\nBy default, the Forgot Password operations send users to the Payload Admin panel to reset their password, but you can customize the generated email to send users to the frontend of your app instead by [overriding the email HTML](../authentication/config#forgot-password).\n\n**Example REST API Forgot Password**:\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/[collection-slug]/forgot-password`, {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n  }),\n})\n```\n\n**Example GraphQL Mutation**:\n\n```\nmutation {\n  forgotPassword[collection-singular-label](email: \"dev@payloadcms.com\")\n}\n```\n\n**Example Local API forgot password**:\n\n```ts\nconst token = await payload.forgotPassword({\n  collection: '[collection-slug]',\n  data: {\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n  },\n  disableEmail: false, // you can disable the auto-generation of email via local API\n})\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  <br />\n  You can stop the reset-password email from being sent via using the local API. This is helpful if\n  you need to create user accounts programmatically, but not set their password for them. This\n  effectively generates a reset password token which you can then use to send to a page you create,\n  allowing a user to \"complete\" their account by setting their password. In the background, you'd\n  use the token to \"reset\" their password.\n</Banner>\n\n### Reset Password\n\nAfter a user has \"forgotten\" their password and a token is generated, that token can be used to send to the reset password operation along with a new password which will allow the user to reset their password securely.\n\n**Example REST API Reset Password**:\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/[collection-slug]/reset-password`, {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    token: 'TOKEN_GOES_HERE'\n    password: 'not-today',\n  }),\n});\n\nconst json = await res.json();\n\n// JSON will be equal to the following:\n/*\n{\n  user: {\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n    createdAt: \"2020-12-27T21:16:45.645Z\",\n    updatedAt: \"2021-01-02T18:37:41.588Z\",\n    id: \"5ae8f9bde69e394e717c8832\"\n  },\n  token: '34o4345324...',\n  exp: 1609619861\n}\n*/\n```\n\n**Example GraphQL Mutation**:\n\n```graphql\nmutation {\n  resetPassword[collection-singular-label](token: \"TOKEN_GOES_HERE\", password: \"not-today\")\n}\n```\n",

        "content": "\n<Banner>\n  Payload's powerful Versions functionality allows you to keep a running history of changes over\n  time and extensible to fit any content publishing workflow.\n</Banner>\n\nWhen enabled, Payload will automatically scaffold a new Collection in your database to store versions of your document(s) over time, and the Admin UI will be extended with additional views that allow you to browse document versions, view diffs in order to see exactly what has changed in your documents (and when they changed), and restore documents back to prior versions easily.\n\n![Versions](/images/docs/versions.png)\n_Comparing an old version to a newer version of a document_\n\n**With Versions, you can:**\n\n- Maintain an audit log / history of every change ever made to a document, including monitoring for what user made which change\n- Restore documents and globals to prior states in case you need to roll back changes\n- Build a true [Draft Preview](../versions/drafts) mode for your data\n- Manage who can see Drafts, and who can only see Published documents via [Access Control](../access-control/overview)\n- Enable [Autosave](../versions/autosave) on collections and globals to never lose your work again\n- Build a powerful publishing schedule mechanism to create documents and have them become publicly readable automatically at a future date\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  Versions are extremely performant and totally opt-in. They don't change the shape of your data at\n  all. All versions are stored in a separate Collection and can be turned on and off easily at your\n  discretion.\n</Banner>\n\n### Options\n\nVersions support a few different levels of functionality that each come with their own impacts to document workflow.\n\n##### Versions enabled, drafts disabled\n\nIf you enable versions but keep draft mode disabled, Payload will simply create a new version of a document each time you update a document. This is great for use cases where you need to retain a history of all document updates over time, but always want to treat the newest document version as the version that is \"published\".\n\nFor example, a use case for \"versions enabled, drafts disabled\" could be on a collection of users, where you might want to keep a version history (or audit log) of all changes ever made to users - but any changes to users should _always_ be treated as \"published\" and you have no need to maintain a \"draft\" version of a user.\n\n##### Versions and drafts enabled\n\nIf you have versions _and_ drafts enabled, you are able to control which documents are published, and which are considered draft. That lets you write [access control](../access-control/overview) to control who can see published documents, and who can see draft documents. It also lets you save versions (drafts) that are _newer_ than your most recently published document, which is helpful if you want to draft changes and maybe even preview them before you publish the changes. Read more about Drafts [here](../versions/drafts).\n\n##### Versions, drafts, and autosave enabled\n\nWhen you have versions, drafts, _and_ `autosave` enabled, the Admin UI will automatically save changes that you make to a new `draft` version as you edit a document, which makes sure that you never lose your changes ever again. Autosave will not affect your published post at all—instead, it'll just save your changes and let you publish them whenever you or your editors are ready to do so. Read more about Autosave [here](../versions/autosave).\n\n### Collection config\n\nConfiguring Versions is done by adding the `versions` key to your Collection configs. Set it to `true` to enable default Versions settings, or customize versions options by setting the property equal to an object containing the following available options:\n\n| Option      | Description                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `maxPerDoc` | Use this setting to control how many versions to keep on a document by document basis. Must be an integer. Defaults to 100, use 0 to save all versions.            |\n| `drafts `   | Enable [Drafts](../versions/drafts) mode for this collection. To enable, set to `true` or pass an object with `draft` [options](../versions/drafts#options). |\n\n### Global config\n\nGlobal versions work similarly to Collection versions but have a slightly different set of config properties supported.\n\n| Option   | Description                                                                                                                                                   |\n| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `max`    | Use this setting to control how many versions to keep on a global by global basis. Must be an integer.                                                        |\n| `drafts` | Enable [Drafts](../versions/drafts) mode for this global. To enable, set to `true` or pass an object with `draft` [options](../versions/drafts#options) |\n\n#### Database impact\n\nBy enabling `versions`, a new database collection will be made to store versions for your collection or global. The collection will be named based off the `slug` of the collection or global and will follow this pattern (where `slug` is replaced with the `slug` of your collection or global):\n\n```\n_slug_versions\n```\n\nEach document in this new `versions` collection will store a set of meta properties about the version as well as a _full_ copy of the document. For example, a version's data might look like this for a Collection document:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_id\": \"61cf752c19cdf1b1af7b61f1\", // a unique ID of this version\n  \"parent\": \"61ce1354091d5b3ffc20ea6e\", // the ID of the parent document\n  \"autosave\": false, // used to denote if this version was created via autosave\n  \"version\": {\n    // your document's data goes here\n    // all fields are set to not required and this property can be partially complete\n  },\n  \"createdAt\": \"2021-12-31T21:25:00.992+00:00\",\n  \"updatedAt\": \"2021-12-31T21:25:00.992+00:00\"\n}\n```\n\nGlobal versions are stored the same as the collection version shown above, except they do not feature the `parent` property, as each Global receives its own `versions` collection. That means we know that all versions in that collection correspond to that specific global.\n\n### Version operations\n\nVersions expose new operations for both collections and globals. They allow you to find and query versions, find a single version by ID, and publish (or restore) a version by ID. Both Collections and Globals support the same new operations. They are used primarily by the admin UI, but if you are writing custom logic in your app and would like to utilize them, they're available for you to use as well via REST, GraphQL, and Local APIs.\n\n**Collection REST endpoints:**\n\n| Method | Path                                 | Description                       |\n| ------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |\n| `GET`  | `/api/{collectionSlug}/versions`     | Find and query paginated versions |\n| `GET`  | `/api/{collectionSlug}/versions/:id` | Find a specific version by ID     |\n| `POST` | `/api/{collectionSlug}/versions/:id` | Restore a version by ID           |\n\n**Collection GraphQL queries:**\n\n| Query Name                               | Operation         |\n| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| **`version{collection.label.singular}`** | `findVersionByID` |\n| **`versions{collection.label.plural}`**  | `findVersions`    |\n\n**And mutation:**\n\n| Query Name                                      | Operation        |\n| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |\n| **`restoreVersion{collection.label.singular}`** | `restoreVersion` |\n\n**Collection Local API methods:**\n\n#### Find\n\n```js\n// Result will be a paginated set of Versions.\n// See /docs/queries/pagination for more.\nconst result = await payload.findVersions({\n  collection: 'posts', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  page: 1,\n  limit: 10,\n  where: {}, // pass a `where` query here\n  sort: '-createdAt',\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n#### Find by ID\n\n```js\n// Result will be a Post document.\nconst result = await payload.findVersionByID({\n  collection: 'posts', // required\n  id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439013', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n#### Restore\n\n```js\n// Result will be the restored global document.\nconst result = await payload.restoreVersion({\n  collection: 'posts', // required\n  id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439013', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n**Global REST endpoints:**\n\n| Method | Path                                     | Description                       |\n| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |\n| `GET`  | `/api/globals/{globalSlug}/versions`     | Find and query paginated versions |\n| `GET`  | `/api/globals/{globalSlug}/versions/:id` | Find a specific version by ID     |\n| `POST` | `/api/globals/{globalSlug}/versions/:id` | Restore a version by ID           |\n\n**Global GraphQL queries:**\n\n| Query Name                   | Operation         |\n| ---------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| **`version{global.label}`**  | `findVersionByID` |\n| **`versions{global.label}`** | `findVersions`    |\n\n**Global GraphQL mutation:**\n\n| Query Name                         | Operation        |\n| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- |\n| **`restoreVersion{global.label}`** | `restoreVersion` |\n\n**Global Local API methods:**\n\n#### Find\n\n```js\n// Result will be a paginated set of Versions.\n// See /docs/queries/pagination for more.\nconst result = await payload.findGlobalVersions({\n  slug: 'header', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  page: 1,\n  limit: 10,\n  where: {}, // pass a `where` query here\n  sort: '-createdAt',\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n#### Find by ID\n\n```js\n// Result will be a Post document.\nconst result = await payload.findGlobalVersionByID({\n  slug: 'header', // required\n  id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439013', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n#### Restore\n\n```js\n// Result will be the restored global document.\nconst result = await payload.restoreGlobalVersion({\n  slug: 'header', // required\n  id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439013', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n### Access Control\n\nVersions expose a new access control function on both Collections and Globals that allow for you to control who can see versions of documents, and who can't.\n\n**New version access control:**\n\n| Function           | Allows/Denies Access                                                                                                   |\n| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`readVersions`** | Used to control who can read versions, and who can't.

This functionality allows you to build powerful Preview environments for your data, where you can make sure your changes look good before publishing documents.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">Drafts rely on Versions being enabled in order to function.</Banner>\n\nBy enabling Versions with Drafts, your collections and globals can maintain _newer_, and _unpublished_ versions of your documents. It's perfect for cases where you might want to work on a document, update it and save your progress, but not necessarily make it publicly published right away. Drafts are extremely helpful when building preview implementations.\n\n![Drafts Enabled](/images/docs/drafts-enabled.png)\n_If Drafts are enabled, the typical Save button is replaced with new actions which allow you to either save a draft, or publish your changes._\n\n### Options\n\nCollections and Globals both support the same options for configuring drafts. You can either set `versions.drafts` to `true`, or pass an object to configure draft properties.\n\n| Draft Option | Description                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `autosave`   | Enable `autosave` to automatically save progress while documents are edited. To enable, set to `true` or pass an object with [options](../versions/autosave). |\n| `validate`   | Set `validate` to `true` to validate draft documents when saved. Default is `false`.                                                                             |\n\n### Database changes\n\nBy enabling drafts on a collection or a global, Payload will <strong>automatically inject a new field into your schema</strong> called `_status`. The `_status` field is used internally by Payload to store if a document is set to `draft` or `published`.\n\n**Admin UI status indication**\n\nWithin the Admin UI, if drafts are enabled, a document can be shown with one of three \"statuses\":\n\n1. <strong>Draft</strong> - if a document has never been published, and only draft versions of the document\n   are present\n1. <strong>Published</strong> - if a document is published and there are no newer drafts available\n1. <strong>Changed</strong> - if a document has been published, but there are newer drafts available\n   and not yet published\n\n### Draft API\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  If drafts are enabled on your collection or global, important and powerful changes are made to\n  your REST, GraphQL, and Local APIs that allow you to specify if you are interacting with drafts or\n  with live documents.\n</Banner>\n\n##### Updating or creating drafts\n\nIf you enable drafts on a collection or global, the `create` and `update` operations for REST, GraphQL, and Local APIs expose a new option called `draft` which allows you to specify if you are creating or updating a <strong>draft</strong>, or if you're just sending your changes straight to the published document. For example, if you pass the query parameter `?draft=true` to a REST `create` or `update` operation, your action will be treated as if you are creating a `draft` and not a published document. By default, the `draft` argument is set to `false`.\n\n**Required fields**\n\nIf `draft` is enabled while creating or updating a document, all fields are considered as not required, so that you can save drafts that are incomplete.\n\n##### Reading drafts vs. published documents\n\nIn addition to the `draft` argument within `create` and `update` operations, a `draft` argument is also exposed for `find` and `findByID` operations.\n\nIf `draft` is set to `true` while reading a document, <strong>Payload will automatically replace returned document(s) with their newest drafts</strong> if any newer drafts are available.\n\n<strong>For example, let's take the following scenario:</strong>\n\n1. You create a new collection document and publish it right away\n1. You then make some updates, and save the updates as a draft\n1. You then make some further updates, and save more updates as another draft\n\nHere, you will have a published document that resides in your main collection, and then you'll have two _newer_ drafts that reside in the `_[collectionSlug]_versions` database collection.\n\nIf you simply fetch your created document using a `find` or `findByID` operation, your published document will be returned and the drafts will be ignored.\n\nBut, if you specify `draft` as `true`, Payload will automatically replace your published document's content with content coming from the most recently saved `version`. In this case, as we have created _two_ versions in the above scenario, Payload will send back data from the newest (second) draft and your document will appear as the most recently drafted version instead of the published version.\n\n### Controlling who can see Collection drafts\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  If you're using the <strong>drafts</strong> feature, it's important for you to consider who can\n  view your drafts, and who can view only published documents. Luckily, Payload makes this extremely\n  simple and puts the power completely in your hands.\n</Banner>\n\n##### Restricting draft access\n\nYou can use the `read` [Access Control](../access-control/collections#read) method to restrict who is able to view drafts of your documents by simply returning a [query constraint](../queries/overview) which restricts the documents that any given user is able to retrieve.\n\nHere is an example that utilizes the `_status` field to require a user to be logged in to retrieve drafts:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Pages: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'pages',\n  access: {\n    read: ({ req }) => {\n      // If there is a user logged in,\n      // let them retrieve all documents\n      if (req.user) return true\n\n      // If there is no user,\n      // restrict the documents that are returned\n      // to only those where `_status` is equal to `published`\n      return {\n        _status: {\n          equals: 'published',\n        },\n      }\n    },\n  },\n  versions: {\n    drafts: true,\n  },\n  //.. the rest of the Pages config here\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note regarding adding versions to an existing collection</strong>\n  <br />\n  If you already have a collection with documents, and you <em>opt in</em> to draft functionality\n  after you have already created existing documents, all of your old documents{' '}\n  <em>will not have a _status field</em> until you resave them. For this reason, if you are{' '}\n  <em>adding</em> versions into an existing collection, you might want to write your access control\n  function to allow for users to read both documents where{' '}\n  <strong>_status is equal to \"published\"</strong> as well as where{' '}\n  <strong>_status does not exist</strong>.\n</Banner>\n\nHere is an example for how to write an access control function that grants access to both documents where `_status` is equal to \"published\" and where `_status` does not exist:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Pages: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'pages',\n  access: {\n    read: ({ req }) => {\n      // If there is a user logged in,\n      // let them retrieve all documents\n      if (req.user) return true\n\n      // If there is no user,\n      // restrict the documents that are returned\n      // to only those where `_status` is equal to `published`\n      // or where `_status` does not exist\n      return {\n        or: [\n          {\n            _status: {\n              equals: 'published',\n            },\n          },\n          {\n            _status: {\n              exists: false,\n            },\n          },\n        ],\n      }\n    },\n  },\n  versions: {\n    drafts: true,\n  },\n  //.. the rest of the Pages config here\n}\n```\n\n### Unpublishing drafts\n\nIf a document is published, the Payload Admin UI will be updated to show an \"unpublish\" button at the top of the sidebar, which will \"unpublish\" the currently published document. Consider this as a way to \"revert\" a document back to a draft state. On the API side, this is done by simply setting `_status: 'draft'` on any document.\n\n### Reverting to published\n\nIf a document is published, and you have made further changes which are saved as a draft, Payload will show a \"revert to published\" button at the top of the sidebar which will allow you to reject your draft changes and \"revert\" back to the published state of the document. Your drafts will still be saved, but a new version will be created that will reflect the last published state of the document.\n",

When set to `true`, Payload will treat the incoming draft update as an `autosave`. This is primarily used by the Admin UI, but there may be some cases where you are building an app for your users and wish to implement `autosave` in your own app. To do so, use the `autosave` argument in your `update` operations.\n\n#### How autosaves are stored\n\nIf we created a new version for each autosave, you'd quickly find a ton of autosaves that clutter up your `_versions` collection within the database. That would be messy quick because `autosave` is typically set to save a document at ~800ms intervals.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  Instead of creating a new version each time a document is autosaved, Payload smartly only creates{' '}\n  <strong>one</strong> autosave version, and then updates that specific version with each autosave\n  performed.

In addition to the Upload options specifiable on a Collection by Collection basis, you can also control the `express-fileupload` options by passing your base Payload config an `upload` property containing an object supportive of all `express-fileupload` properties which use `Busboy` under the hood. [Click here](https://github.com/mscdex/busboy#api) for more documentation about what you can control.\n\nA common example of what you might want to customize within Payload-wide Upload options would be to increase the allowed `fileSize` of uploads sent to Payload:\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    {\n      slug: 'media',\n      fields: [\n        {\n          name: 'alt',\n          type: 'text',\n        },\n      ],\n      upload: true,\n    },\n  ],\n  upload: {\n    limits: {\n      fileSize: 5000000, // 5MB, written in bytes\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Image Sizes\n\nIf you specify an array of `imageSizes` to your `upload` config, Payload will automatically crop and resize your uploads to fit each of the sizes specified by your config.\n\nThe Payload Admin panel will also automatically display all available files, including width, height, and filesize, for each of your uploaded files.\n\nBehind the scenes, Payload relies on [`sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-resize#resize) to perform its image resizing. You can specify additional options for `sharp` to use while resizing your images.\n\n##### Accessing the resized images in hooks\n\nAll auto-resized images are exposed to be re-used in hooks and similar via an object that is bound to `req.payloadUploadSizes`.\n\nThe object will have keys for each size generated, and each key will be set equal to a buffer containing the file data.\n\n##### Handling Image Enlargement\n\nWhen an uploaded image is smaller than the defined image size, we have 3 options:\n\n`withoutEnlargement: undefined | false | true`\n\n1.`undefined` [default]: uploading images with smaller width AND height than the image size will return null\n2. `false`: always enlarge images to the image size\n3. `true`: if the image is smaller than the image size, return the original image\n\n<Banner type=\"error\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  By default, the image size will return NULL when the uploaded image is smaller than the defined image size.\n  Use the `withoutEnlargement` prop to change this.\n</Banner>\n\n### Crop and Focal Point Selector\n\nThis feature is only available for image file types.\n\nSetting `crop: false` and `focalPoint: false` in your Upload config will be disable the respective selector in the Admin panel.\n\nImage cropping occurs before any resizing, the resized images will therefore be generated from the cropped image (**not** the original image).\n\nIf no resizing options are specified (`imageSizes` or `resizeOptions`), the focal point selector will not be displayed.\n\n### Disabling Local Upload Storage\n\nIf you are using a plugin to send your files off to a third-party file storage host or CDN, like Amazon S3 or similar, you may not want to store your files locally at all. You can prevent Payload from writing files to disk by specifying `disableLocalStorage: true` on your collection's upload config.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  This is a fairly advanced feature. If you do disable local file storage, by default, your admin\n  panel's thumbnails will be broken as you will not have stored a file. It will be totally up to you\n  to use either a plugin or your own hooks to store your files in a permanent manner, as well as\n  provide your own admin thumbnail using <strong>upload.adminThumbnail</strong>.\n</Banner>\n\n### Admin Thumbnails\n\nYou can specify how Payload retrieves admin thumbnails for your upload-enabled Collections. This property accepts two different configurations:\n\n1. A string equal to one of your provided image size names to use for the admin panel's thumbnail (seen in the example Media collection above)\n1. A function that takes the document's data and sends back a full URL to load the thumbnail. For example, to dynamically set an admin thumbnail URL, you could write a function that returns a string pointing to a different file source:\n\n**Example custom Admin thumbnail:**\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Media: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'media',\n  upload: {\n    staticURL: '/media',\n    staticDir: 'media',\n    imageSizes: [\n      // ... image sizes here\n    ],\n    // highlight-start\n    adminThumbnail: ({ doc }) =>\n      `https://google.com/custom-path-to-file/${doc.filename}`,\n    // highlight-end\n  },\n}\n```\n\n<Banner>\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  This function runs in the browser. If your function returns `null` or `false` Payload will show\n  the default generic file thumbnail instead.\n</Banner>\n\n### MimeTypes\n\nSpecifying the `mimeTypes` property can restrict what files are allowed from the user's file picker. This accepts an array of strings, which can be any valid mimetype or mimetype wildcards\n\nSome example values are: `image/*`, `audio/*`, `video/*`, `image/png`, `application/pdf`\n\n**Example mimeTypes usage:**\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Media: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'media',\n  upload: {\n    staticURL: '/media',\n    staticDir: 'media',\n    mimeTypes: ['image/*', 'application/pdf'], // highlight-line\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Uploading Files\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important:</strong>\n  <br />\n  Uploading files is currently only possible through the REST and Local APIs due to how GraphQL\n  works. It's difficult and fairly nonsensical to support uploading files through GraphQL.\n</Banner>\n\nTo upload a file, use your collection's [`create`](../rest-api/overview#collections) endpoint. Send it all the data that your Collection requires, as well as a `file` key containing the file that you'd like to upload.\n\nSend your request as a `multipart/form-data` request, using [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) if possible.\n\n[Here is a walkthrough](https://muffinman.io/blog/uploading-files-using-fetch-multipart-form-data/) detailing how to upload files as `multipart/form-data` using React.\n\n### Access Control\n\nAll files that are uploaded to each Collection automatically support the `read` [Access Control](../access-control/overview) function from the Collection itself. You can use this to control who should be allowed to see your uploads, and who should not.\n",

If you have a collection as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types';\n\nexport const PublicUser: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'public-users',\n  auth: true, // Auth is enabled\n  fields: [\n    ...\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n**Payload will automatically open up the following queries:**\n\n| Query Name              | Operation           |\n| ------------------      | ------------------- |\n| **`PublicUser`**        | `findByID`          |\n| **`PublicUsers`**       | `find`              |\n| **`countPublicUsers`**  | `count`             |\n| **`mePublicUser`**      | `me` auth operation |\n\n**And the following mutations:**\n\n| Query Name                     | Operation                       |\n| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n| **`createPublicUser`**         | `create`                        |\n| **`updatePublicUser`**         | `update`                        |\n| **`deletePublicUser`**         | `delete`                        |\n| **`forgotPasswordPublicUser`** | `forgotPassword` auth operation |\n| **`resetPasswordPublicUser`**  | `resetPassword` auth operation  |\n| **`unlockPublicUser`**         | `unlock` auth operation         |\n| **`verifyPublicUser`**         | `verify` auth operation         |\n| **`loginPublicUser`**          | `login` auth operation          |\n| **`logoutPublicUser`**         | `logout` auth operation         |\n| **`refreshTokenPublicUser`**   | `refresh` auth operation        |\n\n## Globals\n\nGlobals are also fully supported. For example:\n\n```ts\nimport { GlobalConfig } from 'payload/types';\n\nconst Header: GlobalConfig = {\n  slug: 'header',\n  fields: [\n    ...\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n**Payload will open the following query:**\n\n| Query Name   | Operation |\n| ------------ | --------- |\n| **`Header`** | `findOne` |\n\n**And the following mutation:**\n\n| Query Name         | Operation |\n| ------------------ | --------- |\n| **`updateHeader`** | `update`  |\n\n## Preferences\n\nUser [preferences](../admin/overview#preferences) for the admin panel are also available to GraphQL the same way as other collection schemas are generated. To query preferences you must supply an authorization token in the header and only the preferences of that user will be accessible.\n\n**Payload will open the following query:**\n\n| Query Name       | Operation |\n| ---------------- | --------- |\n| **`Preference`** | `findOne` |\n\n**And the following mutations:**\n\n| Query Name             | Operation |\n| ---------------------- | --------- |\n| **`updatePreference`** | `update`  |\n| **`deletePreference`** | `delete`  |\n\n## GraphQL Playground\n\nGraphQL Playground is enabled by default for development purposes, but disabled in production. You can enable it in production by passing `graphQL.disablePlaygroundInProduction` a `false` setting in the main Payload config.\n\nYou can even log in using the `login[collection-singular-label-here]` mutation to use the Playground as an authenticated user.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  <br />\n  To see more regarding how the above queries and mutations are used, visit your GraphQL playground\n  (by default at\n  [http://localhost:3000/api/graphql-playground](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql-playground))\n  while your server is running. There, you can use the \"Schema\" and \"Docs\" buttons on the right to\n  see a ton of detail about how GraphQL operates within Payload.\n</Banner>\n\n## Query complexity limits\n\nPayload comes with a built-in query complexity limiter to prevent bad people from trying to slow down your server by running massive queries.

        "content": "\nYou can add your own GraphQL queries and mutations to Payload, making use of all the types that Payload has defined for you.\n\nTo do so, add your queries and mutations to the main Payload config as follows:\n\n| Config Path         | Description                                                                 |\n| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `graphQL.queries`   | Function that returns an object containing keys to custom GraphQL queries   |\n| `graphQL.mutations` | Function that returns an object containing keys to custom GraphQL mutations |\n\nThe above properties each receive a function that is defined with the following arguments:\n\n**`GraphQL`**\n\nThis is Payload's GraphQL dependency. You should not install your own copy of GraphQL as a dependency due to underlying restrictions based on how GraphQL works. Instead, you can use the Payload-provided copy via this argument.\n\n**`payload`**\n\nThis is a copy of the currently running Payload instance, which provides you with existing GraphQL types for all of your Collections and Globals - among other things.\n\n##### Return value\n\nBoth `graphQL.queries` and `graphQL.mutations` functions should return an object with properties equal to your newly written GraphQL queries and mutations.\n\n### Example\n\n`payload.config.js`:\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport myCustomQueryResolver from './graphQL/resolvers/myCustomQueryResolver'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  graphQL: {\n    // highlight-start\n    queries: (GraphQL, payload) => {\n      return {\n        MyCustomQuery: {\n          type: new GraphQL.GraphQLObjectType({\n            name: 'MyCustomQuery',\n            fields: {\n              text: {\n                type: GraphQL.GraphQLString,\n              },\n              someNumberField: {\n                type: GraphQL.GraphQLFloat,\n              },\n            },\n          }),\n          args: {\n            argNameHere: {\n              type: new GraphQL.GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString),\n            },\n          },\n          resolve: myCustomQueryResolver,\n        },\n      }\n    },\n    // highlight-end\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Resolver function\n\nIn your resolver, make sure you set `depth: 0` if you're returning data directly from the local API so that GraphQL can correctly resolve queries to nested values such as relationship data.\n\nYour function will receive four arguments you can make use of:\n\nExample\n\n```ts\n;async (obj, args, context, info) => {}\n```\n\n**`obj`**\n\nThe previous object. Not very often used and usually discarded.\n\n**`args`**\n\nThe available arguments from your query or mutation will be available to you here, these must be configured via the custom operation first.\n\n**`context`**\n\nAn object containing the `req` and `res` objects that will provide you with the `payload`, `user` instances and more, like any other Payload API handler.\n\n**`info`**\n\nContextual information about the currently running GraphQL operation. You can get schema information from this as well as contextual information about where this resolver function is being run.\n\n### Types\n\nWe've exposed a few types and utilities to help you extend the API further. Payload uses the GraphQL.js package for which you can view the full list of available types in the [official documentation](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/).\n\n**`GraphQL`**\n\nYou can directly import the GraphQL package used by Payload, most useful for typing. For queries, mutations and handlers make sure you use the `GraphQL` and `payload` instances provided via arguments.\n\n**`buildPaginatedListType`**\n\nThis is a utility function that allows you to build a new GraphQL type for a paginated result similar to the Payload's generated schema.\nIt takes in two arguments, the first for the name of this new schema type and the second for the GraphQL type to be used in the docs parameter.\n\nExample\n\n```ts\nexport const getMyPosts = (GraphQL, payload) => {\n  return {\n    args: {},\n    resolve: Resolver,\n    // The name of your new type has to be unique\n    type: buildPaginatedListType('AuthorPosts', payload.collections['posts'].graphQL?.type),\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**`payload.collections.slug.graphQL`**\n\nIf you want to extend more of the provided API then the `graphQL` object on your collection slug will contain additional types to help you re-use code for types, mutations and queries.\n\n```ts\ngraphQL?: {\n  type: GraphQLObjectType\n  paginatedType: GraphQLObjectType\n  JWT: GraphQLObjectType\n  versionType: GraphQLObjectType\n  whereInputType: GraphQLInputObjectType\n  mutationInputType: GraphQLNonNull<any>\n  updateMutationInputType: GraphQLNonNull<any>\n}\n```\n\n### Best practices\n\nThere are a few ways to structure your code, we recommend using a dedicated `graphql` directory so you can keep all of your logic in one place. You have total freedom of how you want to structure this but a common pattern is to group functions by type and with their resolver.\n\nExample\n\n```\nsrc/graphql\n---- queries/\n     index.ts\n    -- myCustomQuery/\n       index.ts\n       resolver.ts\n\n---- mutations/\n```\n",

        "content": "\nWhen working with GraphQL it is useful to have the schema for development of other projects that need to call on your GraphQL endpoint. In Payload the schema is controlled by your collections and globals and is made available to the developer or third parties, it is not necessary for developers using Payload to write schema types manually.\n\n### Schema generation script\n\nRun the following command in a Payload project to generate your project's GraphQL schema from Payload:\n\n```\npayload generate:graphQLSchema\n```\n\nYou can run this command whenever you need to regenerate your GraphQL schema and output it to a file, and then you can use the schema for writing your own GraphQL elsewhere in other projects.\n\n### Custom output file path\n\n```js\n{\n  // the remainder of your config\n\tgraphQL: {\n\t\tschemaOutputFile: path.resolve(__dirname, './graphql/schema.graphql'),\n\t},\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Field Schemas\n\nFor `array`, `block`, `group` and named `tab` fields, you can generate top level reusable interfaces. The following group field config:\n\n```ts\n{\n  type: 'group',\n  name: 'meta',\n  interfaceName: 'SharedMeta', <-- here!!\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'title',\n      type: 'text',\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'description',\n      type: 'text',\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nwill generate:\n\n```ts\n// a top level reusable type!!\ntype SharedMeta {\n  title: String\n  description: String\n}\n\n// example usage inside collection schema\ntype Collection1 {\n  // ...other fields\n  meta: SharedMeta\n}\n```\n\nThe above example outputs all your definitions to a file relative from your payload config as `./graphql/schema.graphql`. By default, the file will be output to your current working directory as `schema.graphql`.\n\n#### Adding an NPM script\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important</strong>\n  <br />\n  Payload needs to be able to find your config to generate your GraphQL schema.\n</Banner>\n\nPayload will automatically try and locate your config, but might not always be able to find it. For example, if you are working in a `/src` directory or similar, you need to tell Payload where to find your config manually by using an environment variable. If this applies to you, you can create an NPM script to make generating your types easier.\n\nTo add an NPM script to generate your types and show Payload where to find your config, open your `package.json` and update the `scripts` property to the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"generate:graphQLSchema\": \"cross-env PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH=src/payload.config.ts payload generate:graphQLSchema\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow you can run `yarn generate:graphQLSchema` to easily generate your schema.\n",

Payload also has REST endpoints to manage the admin user [preferences](../admin/overview#preferences) for data specific to the authenticated user.\n\n<RestExamples\n  data={[\n    {\n      operation:

of `endpoints` in various places within a Payload config. Custom endpoints are useful for adding additional middleware on existing routes or for building custom functionality into Payload apps and plugins. Endpoints can be added at the top of the Payload config, `collections`, and `globals` and accessed respective of the api and slugs you have configured.\n\nEach endpoint object needs to have:\n\n| Property      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`path`**    | A string for the endpoint route after the collection or globals slug                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| **`method`**  | The lowercase HTTP verb to use: 'get', 'head', 'post', 'put', 'delete', 'connect' or 'options'                                                                                                                                                             |\n| **`handler`** | A function or array of functions to be called with **req**, **res** and **next** arguments. [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-handlers)                                                                                          |\n| **`root`**    | When `true`, defines the endpoint on the root Express app, bypassing Payload handlers and the `routes.api` subpath. Note: this only applies to top-level endpoints of your Payload config, endpoints defined on `collections` or `globals` cannot be root. |\n| **`custom`**  | Extension point for adding custom data (e.g. for plugins)                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\n// a collection of 'orders' with an additional route for tracking details, reachable at /api/orders/:id/tracking\nexport const Orders: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'orders',\n  fields: [\n    /* ... */\n  ],\n  // highlight-start\n  endpoints: [\n    {\n      path: '/:id/tracking',\n      method: 'get',\n      handler: async (req, res, next) => {\n        const tracking = await getTrackingInfo(req.params.id)\n        if (tracking) {\n          res.status(200).send({ tracking })\n        } else {\n          res.status(404).send({ error: 'not found' })\n        }\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n  // highlight-end\n}\n```\n\n<Banner>\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  **req** will have the **payload** object and can be used inside your endpoint handlers for making\n  calls like req.payload.find() that will make use of access control and hooks.\n</Banner>\n",

Here, you don't need to deal with server latency or network speed whatsoever and\ncan interact directly with your database.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  <strong>Tip:</strong>\n  <br />\n  The Local API is incredibly powerful when used with server-side rendering app frameworks like\n  NextJS. With other headless CMS, you need to request your data from third-party servers which can\n  add significant loading time to your server-rendered pages. With Payload, you don't have to leave\n  your server to gather the data you need. It can be incredibly fast and is definitely a game\n  changer.\n</Banner>\n\nHere are some common examples of how you can use the Local API:\n\n- Seeding data via Node seed scripts that you write and maintain\n- Opening custom Express routes which feature additional functionality but still rely on Payload\n- Within access control and hook functions\n\n### Accessing payload\n\nYou can gain access to the currently running `payload` object via two ways:\n\n##### Importing it\n\nYou can import or require `payload` into your own files after it's been initialized, but you need to make sure that\nyour `import` / `require` statements come **after** you call `payload.init()`—otherwise Payload won't have been\ninitialized yet. That might be obvious. To us, it's usually not.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport payload from 'payload'\nimport { CollectionAfterChangeHook } from 'payload/types'\n\nconst afterChangeHook: CollectionAfterChangeHook = async () => {\n  const posts = await payload.find({\n    collection: 'posts',\n  })\n}\n```\n\n##### Accessing from the `req`\n\nPayload is available anywhere you have access to the Express `req` - including within your access control and hook\nfunctions.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nconst afterChangeHook: CollectionAfterChangeHook = async ({ req: { payload } }) => {\n  const posts = await payload.find({\n    collection: 'posts',\n  })\n}\n```\n\n### Local options available\n\nYou can specify more options within the Local API vs. REST or GraphQL due to the server-only context that they are\nexecuted in.\n\n| Local Option       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `collection`       | Required for Collection operations.

 By default, all access control checks are disabled in the Local API, but you can re-enable them if\n  you'd like, as well as pass a specific user to run the operation with.\n</Banner>\n\n## Collections\n\nThe following Collection operations are available through the Local API:\n\n#### Create\n\n```js\n// The created Post document is returned\nconst post = await payload.create({\n  collection: 'posts', // required\n  data: {\n    // required\n    title: 'sure',\n    description: 'maybe',\n  },\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUserDoc,\n  overrideAccess: true,\n  showHiddenFields: false,\n\n  // If creating verification-enabled auth doc,\n  // you can optionally disable the email that is auto-sent\n  disableVerificationEmail: true,\n\n  // If your collection supports uploads, you can upload\n  // a file directly through the Local API by providing\n  // its full, absolute file path.\n  filePath: path.resolve(__dirname, './path-to-image.jpg'),\n\n  // Alternatively, you can directly pass a File,\n  // if file is provided, filePath will be omitted\n  file: uploadedFile,\n})\n```\n\n#### Find\n\n```js\n// Result will be a paginated set of Posts.\n// See /docs/queries/pagination for more.\nconst result = await payload.find({\n  collection: 'posts', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  page: 1,\n  limit: 10,\n  pagination: false, // If you want to disable pagination count, etc.\n  where: {}, // pass a `where` query here\n  sort: '-title',\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess:

Count\n\n```js\n// Result will be an object with:\n// {\n//   totalDocs: 10, // count of the documents satisfies query\n// }\nconst result = await payload.count({\n  collection: 'posts', // required\n  locale: 'en',\n  where: {}, // pass a `where` query here\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n})\n```\n\n#### Update by ID\n\n```js\n// Result will be the updated Post document.\nconst result = await payload.update({\n  collection: 'posts', // required\n  id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439011', // required\n  data: {\n    // required\n    title: 'sure',\n    description: 'maybe',\n  },\n

replace\n  // the existing file instead of generating a new filename,\n  // you can set the following property to `true`\n  overwriteExistingFiles: true,\n})\n```\n\n#### Update Many\n\n```js\n// Result will be an object with:\n// {\n//   docs: [], // each document that was updated\n//   errors: [], // each error also includes the id of the document\n// }\nconst result = await

would like to replace\n  // the existing file instead of generating a new filename,\n  // you can set the following property to `true`\n  overwriteExistingFiles: true,\n})\n```\n\n#### Delete\n\n```js\n// Result will be the now-deleted Post document.\nconst result = await payload.delete({\n  collection: 'posts', // required\n  id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439011', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n#### Delete Many\n\n```js\n// Result will be an object with:\n// {\n//   docs: [], // each document that is now deleted\n//   errors: [], // any errors that occurred, including the id of the errored on document\n// }\nconst result = await payload.delete({\n  collection: 'posts', // required\n  where: {\n    // required\n    fieldName: { equals: 'value' },\n  },\n  depth: 0,\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n## Auth Operations\n\nIf a collection has [`Authentication`](../authentication/overview) enabled, additional Local API operations will be\navailable:\n\n#### Login\n\n```js\n// result will be formatted as follows:\n// {\n//   token: 'o38jf0q34jfij43f3f...', // JWT used for auth\n//   user: { ... } // the user document that just logged in\n//   exp: 1609619861 // the UNIX timestamp when the JWT will expire\n// }\n\nconst result = await payload.login({\n  collection: 'users', // required\n  data: {\n    // required\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n    password: 'rip',\n  },\n  req: req, // pass an Express `req` which will be provided to all hooks\n  res: res, // used to automatically set an HTTP-only auth cookie\n  depth: 2,\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n#### Forgot Password\n\n```js\n// Returned token will allow for a password reset\nconst token = await payload.forgotPassword({\n  collection: 'users', // required\n  data: {\n    // required\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n  },\n  req: req, // pass an Express `req` which will be provided to all hooks\n})\n```\n\n#### Reset Password\n\n```js\n// Result will be formatted as follows:\n// {\n//   token: 'o38jf0q34jfij43f3f...', // JWT used for auth\n//   user: { ... } // the user document that just logged in\n// }\nconst result = await payload.resetPassword({\n  collection: 'users', // required\n  data: {\n    // required\n    password: req.body.password, // the new password to set\n    token: 'afh3o2jf2p3f...', // the token generated from the forgotPassword operation\n  },\n  req: req, // pass an Express `req` which will be provided to all hooks\n  res: res, // used to automatically set an HTTP-only auth cookie\n})\n```\n\n#### Unlock\n\n```js\n// Returned result will be a boolean representing success or failure\nconst result = await payload.unlock({\n  collection: 'users', // required\n  data: {\n    // required\n    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',\n  },\n  req: req, // pass an Express `req` which will be provided to all hooks\n  overrideAccess: true,\n})\n```\n\n#### Verify\n\n```js\n// Returned result will be a boolean representing success or failure\nconst result = await payload.verifyEmail({\n  collection: 'users', // required\n  token: 'afh3o2jf2p3f...', // the token saved on the user as `_verificationToken`\n})\n```\n\n## Globals\n\nThe following Global operations are available through the Local API:\n\n#### Find\n\n```js\n// Result will be the Header Global.\nconst result = await payload.findGlobal({\n  slug: 'header', // required\n  depth: 2,\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n#### Update\n\n```js\n// Result will be the updated Header Global.\nconst result = await payload.updateGlobal({\n  slug: 'header', // required\n  data: {\n    // required\n    nav: [\n      {\n        url: 'https://google.com',\n      },\n      {\n        url: 'https://payloadcms.com',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  depth: 2,\n  locale: 'en',\n  fallbackLocale: false,\n  user: dummyUser,\n  overrideAccess: false,\n  showHiddenFields: true,\n})\n```\n\n## Next.js Conflict with Local API\n\nThere is a known issue when using the Local API with Next.js version `13.4.13` and higher. Next.js executes within a\nseparate child process, and Payload has not been initalized yet in these instances. That means that unless you\nexplicitly initialize Payload within your operation, it will not be running and return no data / an empty object.\n\nAs a workaround, we recommend leveraging the following pattern to determine and ensure Payload is initalized:\n\n```\nimport dotenv from 'dotenv'\nimport path from 'path'\nimport type { Payload } from 'payload'\nimport payload from 'payload'\nimport type { InitOptions } from 'payload/config'\nimport { seed as seedData } from './seed'\n\ndotenv.config({\n  path: path.resolve(__dirname, '../.env'),\n})\n\nlet cached = (global as any).payload\n\nif (!cached) {\n  cached = (global as any).payload = { client: null, promise: null }\n}\n\ninterface Args {\n  initOptions?: Partial<InitOptions>\n  seed?: boolean\n}\n\nexport const getPayloadClient = async ({ initOptions, seed }: Args = {}): Promise<Payload> => {\n  if (!process.env.DATABASE_URI) {\n    throw new Error('DATABASE_URI environment variable is missing')\n  }\n  if (!process.env.PAYLOAD_SECRET) {\n    throw new Error('PAYLOAD_SECRET environment variable is missing')\n  }\n  if (cached.client) {\n    return cached.client\n  }\n  if (!cached.promise) {\n    cached.promise = payload.init({\n      mongoURL: process.env.DATABASE_URI,\n      secret: process.env.PAYLOAD_SECRET,\n      local: initOptions?.express ? false : true,\n      ...(initOptions || {}),\n    })\n  }\n  try {\n    process.env.PAYLOAD_DROP_DATABASE = seed ? 'true' : 'false'\n    cached.client = await cached.promise\n    if (seed) {\n      payload.logger.info('---- SEEDING DATABASE ----')\n      await seedData(payload)\n    }\n  } catch (e: unknown) {\n    cached.promise = null\n    throw e\n  }\n  return cached.client\n}\n```\n\nTo checkout how this works in a project, take a look at\nour [custom server example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/master/examples/custom-server/src/getPayload.ts).\n\n## Example Script using Local API\n\nThe Local API is especially useful for running scripts\n\n```ts\nimport payload from 'payload'\nimport path from 'path'\nimport dotenv from 'dotenv'\n\ndotenv.config({\n  path: path.resolve(__dirname, '../.env'),\n})\n\nconst { PAYLOAD_SECRET } = process.env\n\nconst doAction = async (): Promise<void> => {\n  await payload.init({\n    secret: PAYLOAD_SECRET,\n    local: true, // Enables local mode, doesn't spin up a server or frontend\n  })\n\n  // Perform any Local API operations here\n  await payload.find({\n    collection: 'posts',\n    // where: {} // optional\n  })\n\n  await payload.create({\n    collection: 'posts',\n    data: {},\n  })\n}\n\ndoAction()\n```\n\n## TypeScript\n\nLocal API calls will automatically infer your [generated types](../typescript/generating-types).\n\nHere is an example of usage:\n\n```ts\n// Properly inferred as `Post` type\nconst post = await payload.create({\n  collection: 'posts',\n\n  // Data will now be typed as Post and give you type hints\n  data: {\n    title: 'my title',\n    description: 'my description',\n  },\n})\n```\n",

Each API takes the same syntax and fully supports all options.\n\n<Banner>\n  <strong>Here, \"querying\" relates to filtering or searching through documents within a Collection.</strong>{' '}\n  You can build queries to pass to Find operations as well as to [restrict which documents certain\n  users can access](../access-control/overview) via access control functions.\n</Banner>\n\n### Simple queries\n\nFor example, say you have a collection as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'\n\nexport const Post: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: 'posts',\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'color',\n      type: 'select',\n      options: ['mint', 'dark-gray', 'white'],\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'featured',\n      type: 'checkbox',\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nYou may eventually have a lot of documents within this Collection. If you wanted to find only documents with `color` equal to `mint`, you could write a query as follows:\n\n```js\nconst query = {\n  color: {\n    // property name to filter on\n    equals: 'mint', // operator to use and value to compare against\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThe above example demonstrates a simple query but you can get much more complex.\n\n### Operators\n\n| Operator             | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `equals`             | The value must be exactly equal.                                                                                                                                                  |\n| `not_equals`         | The query will return all documents where the value is not equal.                                                                                                                 |\n| `greater_than`       | For numeric or date-based fields.                                                                                                                                                 |\n| `greater_than_equal` | For numeric or date-based fields.                                                                                                                                                 |\n| `less_than`          | For numeric or date-based fields.                                                                                                                                                 |\n| `less_than_equal`    | For numeric or date-based fields.                                                                                                                                                 |\n| `like`               | Case-insensitive string must be present.

Let's take the above `Post` collection for example and write a more complex query using AND / OR:\n\n```js\nconst query = {\n  or: [\n    // array of OR conditions\n    {\n      color: {\n        equals: 'mint',\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      and: [\n        // nested array of AND conditions\n        {\n          color: {\n            equals: 'white',\n          },\n        },\n        {\n          featured: {\n            equals: false,\n          },\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nWritten in plain English, if the above query were passed to a `find` operation, it would translate to finding posts where either the `color` is `mint` OR the `color` is `white` AND `featured` is set to false.\n\n### Nested properties\n\nWhen working with nested properties, which can happen when using relational fields, it is possible to use the dot notation to access the nested property. For example, when working with a `Song` collection that has a `artists` field which is related to an `Artists` collection using the `name: 'artists'`. You can access a property within the collection `Artists` like so:\n\n```js\nconst query = {\n  'artists.featured': {\n    // nested property name to filter on\n    exists: true, // operator to use and boolean value that needs to be true\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### GraphQL Find Queries\n\nAll GraphQL `find` queries support the `where` argument, which accepts queries exactly as detailed above.\n\n**For example:**\n\n```\nquery {\n  Posts(where: { color: { equals: mint } }) {\n    docs {\n      color\n    }\n    totalDocs\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### REST Queries\n\nWith the REST API, you can use the full power of Payload queries as well but they become a bit more unwieldy the more complex that they get.\n\nSimple queries are fairly straightforward to write. To understand the syntax, you need to understand how Express and similar languages would go about parsing a complex URL search string into a JSON object. For example, the above [simple query](#simple-queries) would be parsed into a string like this:\n\n**`https://localhost:3000/api/posts?where[color][equals]=mint`**\n\nThis one isn't too bad, but more complex queries get unavoidably more difficult to write as query strings. For this reason, we recommend to use the extremely helpful and ubiquitous [`qs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs) package to parse your JSON / object-formatted queries into query strings for use with the REST API.\n\n**For example, using fetch:**\n\n```js\nimport qs from 'qs'\n\nconst query = {\n  color: {\n    equals: 'mint',\n  },\n  // This query could be much more complex\n  // and QS would handle it beautifully\n}\n\nconst getPosts = async () => {\n  const stringifiedQuery = qs.stringify(\n    {\n      where: query, // ensure that `qs` adds the `where` property, too!\n    },\n    { addQueryPrefix: true },\n  )\n\n  const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/posts${stringifiedQuery}`)\n  // Continue to handle the response below...\n}\n```\n\n### Local API Queries\n\nThe Local API's `find` operation accepts an object exactly how you write it. For example:\n\n```js\nconst getPosts = async () => {\n  const posts = await payload.find({\n    collection: 'posts',\n    where: {\n      color: {\n        equals: 'mint',\n      },\n    },\n  })\n\n  return posts\n}\n```\n\n## Sort\n\nPayload `find` queries support a `sort` parameter through all APIs. Pass the `name` of a top-level field to sort by that field in ascending order. Prefix the name of the field with a minus symbol (\"-\") to sort in descending order. Because sorting is handled by the database, the field you wish to sort on must be stored in the database to work; not a [virtual field](https://payloadcms.com/blog/learn-how-virtual-fields-can-help-solve-common-cms-challenges). It is recommended to enable indexing for the fields where sorting is used.\n\n**REST example:**\n**`https://localhost:3000/api/posts?sort=-createdAt`**\n\n**GraphQL example:**\n\n```\nquery {\n  Posts(sort: \"-createdAt\") {\n    docs {\n      color\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Local API example:**\n\n```js\nconst getPosts = async () => {\n  const posts = await payload.find({\n    collection: 'posts',\n    sort: '-createdAt',\n  })\n\n  return posts\n}\n```\n",

Great work!</strong> Now, what's next?\n</Banner>\n\nThere are many ways to deploy Payload to a production environment. When evaluating how you will deploy Payload, you need\nto consider these main aspects:\n\n1. [Basics](#basics)\n1. [Security](#security)\n1. [Your MongoDB](#mongodb)\n1. [Permanent File Storage](#file-storage)\n1. [Docker](#docker)\n\n## Basics\n\nIn order for Payload to run, it requires both the server code and the built admin panel. These will be the `dist`\nand `build` directories by default. If you've used `create-payload-app` to create your project, executing the `build`\nnpm script will build both and output these directories.\n\n## Security\n\nPayload features a suite of security features that you can rely on to strengthen your application's security. When\ndeploying to Production, it's a good idea to double-check that you are making proper use of each of them.\n\n##### The Secret Key\n\nWhen you initialize Payload, you provide it with a `secret` property. This property should be impossible to guess and\nextremely difficult for brute-force attacks to crack. Make sure your Production `secret` is a long, complex string. It's\noften best practice to store it in an `env` file which is not checked into your Git repository, using `dotenv` to supply\nit to your `payload.init` call.\n\n##### Double-check and thoroughly test all Access Control\n\nBecause _**you**_ are in complete control of who can do what with your data, you should double and triple-check that you\nwield that power responsibly before deploying to Production.\n\n<Banner type=\"error\">\n  <strong>By default, all Access Control functions require that a user is successfully logged in to Payload to create, read, update, or delete data.</strong>{' '}\n  But, if you allow public user registration, for example, you will want to make sure that your\n  access control functions are more strict - permitting <strong>only appropriate users</strong> to\n  perform appropriate actions.\n</Banner>\n\n##### Building the Admin panel\n\nBefore running in Production, you need to have built a production-ready copy of the Payload Admin panel. To do this,\nPayload provides the `build` NPM script. You can use it by adding a `script` to your `package.json` file like this:\n\n`package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"project-name-here\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"payload build\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    // your dependencies\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen, to build Payload, you would run `npm run build` in your project folder. A production-ready Admin bundle will be\ncreated in the `build` directory.\n\n##### Setting Node to Production\n\nMake sure you set the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to `production`. Based on this variable, many Node packages\nautomatically optimize themselves. In production, Payload automatically disables\nthe [GraphQL Playground](../graphql/overview#graphql-playground), serves a production-ready version of the Admin\npanel, and other changes.\n\n##### Secure Cookie Settings\n\nYou should be using an SSL certificate for production Payload instances, which means you\ncan [enable secure cookies](../authentication/config) in your Authentication-enabled Collection configs.\n\n##### Preventing API Abuse\n\nPayload comes with a robust set of built-in anti-abuse measures, such as locking out users after X amount of failed\nlogin attempts, request rate limiting, GraphQL query complexity limits, max `depth` settings, and\nmore. [Click here to learn more](../production/preventing-abuse).\n\n## MongoDB\n\nPayload can be used with any MongoDB compatible database including AWS DocumentDB or Azure Cosmos DB.\n\n##### Managing MongoDB yourself\n\nIf you are using a [persistent filesystem-based cloud host](#persistent-vs-ephemeral-filesystems) such as\na [DigitalOcean Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/) or\nan [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?ec2-whats-new.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&ec2-whats-new.sort-order=desc)\nserver, you might opt to install MongoDB directly on that server itself so that Node can communicate with it locally.\nWith this approach, you can benefit from faster response times, but scaling can become more involved as your app's user\nbase grows.\n\n##### Letting someone else do it\n\nAlternatively, you can rely on a third-party MongoDB host such as [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/). With Atlas\nor a similar cloud provider, you can trust them to take care of your database's availability, security, redundancy, and\nbackups.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If versions are enabled and a collection has many documents you may need a minimum of an m10\n  mongoDB atlas cluster if you reach a sorting `exceeded memory limit` error to view a collection\n  list in the admin UI. The limitations of the m2 and m5 tier clusters are here: [Atlas M0 (Free\n  Cluster), M2, and M5\n  Limitations](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/free-shared-limitations/?_ga=2.176267877.1329169847.1677683154-860992573.1647438381#operational-limitations).\n</Banner>\n\n##### DocumentDB\n\nWhen using AWS DocumentDB, you will need to configure connection options for authentication in the `connectOptions`\npassed to the `mongooseAdapter` . You also need to set `connectOptions.useFacet` to `false` to disable use of the\nunsupported `$facet` aggregation.\n\n##### CosmosDB\n\nWhen using Azure Cosmos DB, an index is needed for any field you may want to sort on. To add the sort index for all\nfields that may be sorted in the admin UI use the <a href=\"../configuration/overview\">indexSortableFields</a>\nconfiguration option.\n\n## File storage\n\nIf you are using Payload to [manage file uploads](../upload/overview), you need to consider where your uploaded files\nwill be permanently stored. If you do not use Payload for file uploads, then this section does not impact your app\nwhatsoever.\n\n#### Persistent vs Ephemeral Filesystems\n\nSome cloud app hosts such as [Heroku](https://heroku.com) use `ephemeral` file systems, which means that any files\nuploaded to your server only last until the server restarts or shuts down. Heroku and similar providers schedule\nrestarts and shutdowns without your control, meaning your uploads will accidentally disappear without any way to get\nthem back.\n\nAlternatively, persistent filesystems will never delete your files and can be trusted to reliably host uploads\nperpetually.\n\n**Popular cloud providers with ephemeral filesystems:**\n\n- Heroku\n- DigitalOcean Apps\n\n**Popular cloud providers with persistent filesystems:**\n\n- DigitalOcean Droplets\n- Amazon EC2\n- GoDaddy\n- Many other more traditional web hosts\n\n<Banner type=\"error\">\n  <strong>Warning:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If you rely on Payload's <strong>Upload</strong> functionality, make sure you either use a host\n  with a persistent filesystem or have an integration with a third-party file host like Amazon S3.\n</Banner>\n\n##### Using ephemeral filesystem providers like Heroku\n\nIf you don't use Payload's `upload` functionality, you can go ahead and use Heroku or similar platform easily.\nEverything will work exactly as you want it to.\n\nBut, if you do, and you still want to use an ephemeral filesystem provider, you can write a hook-based solution to\n_copy_ the files your users upload to a more permanent storage solution like Amazon S3 or DigitalOcean Spaces.\n\n**To automatically send uploaded files to S3 or similar, you could:**\n\n- Write an asynchronous `beforeChange` hook for all Collections that support Uploads, which takes any uploaded `file`\n  from the Express `req` and sends it to an S3 bucket\n- Write an `afterRead` hook to save a `s3URL` field that automatically takes the `filename` stored and formats a full S3\n  URL\n- Write an `afterDelete` hook that automatically deletes files from the S3 bucket\n\nWith the above configuration, deploying to Heroku or similar becomes no problem.\n\n## DigitalOcean Tutorials\n\nDigitalOcean provides extremely helpful documentation that can walk you through the entire process of creating a\nproduction-ready Droplet to host your Payload app:\n\n1.

This allows for the expansion of your server's working memory, with some limitations. Swap space comes into\nplay when available RAM can no longer accommodate actively used application data, enabling the system to continue\nfunctioning.\n\nInsufficient space can lead to deployment errors and memory-related issues, resulting in application crashes, sluggish\nperformance, or an unresponsive server.\n\nCommon deployment error due to **space limitations** (as reported by users):\n\n- `Error: Command failed with exit code 1`\n\nTo configure swap, we recommend following this tutorial\non [How To Add Swap Space](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-22-04).\n\n## Docker\n\nThis is an example of a multi-stage docker build of Payload for production. Ensure you are setting your environment\nvariables on deployment, like `PAYLOAD_SECRET`, `PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH`, and `DATABASE_URI` if needed.\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM node:18-alpine as base\n\nFROM base as builder\n\nWORKDIR /home/node\nCOPY package*.json ./\n\nCOPY . .\nRUN yarn install\nRUN yarn build\n\nFROM base as runtime\n\nENV NODE_ENV=production\n\nWORKDIR /home/node\nCOPY package*.json  ./\n\nRUN yarn install --production\nCOPY --from=builder /home/node/dist ./dist\nCOPY --from=builder /home/node/build ./build\n\nEXPOSE 3000\n\nCMD [\"node\", \"dist/server.js\"]\n```\n\n## Docker Compose\n\nHere is an example of a docker-compose.yml file that can be used for development\n\n```yml\nversion: '3'\n\nservices:\n  payload:\n    image: node:18-alpine\n    ports:\n      - '3000:3000'\n    volumes:\n      - .:/home/node/app\n      - node_modules:/home/node/app/node_modules\n    working_dir: /home/node/app/\n    command: sh -c \"yarn install && yarn dev\"\n    depends_on:\n      - mongo\n    environment:\n      DATABASE_URI: mongodb://mongo:27017/payload\n      PORT: 3000\n      NODE_ENV: development\n      PAYLOAD_SECRET: TESTING\n\n  mongo:\n    image: mongo:latest\n    ports:\n      - '27017:27017'\n    command:\n      - --storageEngine=wiredTiger\n    volumes:\n      - data:/data/db\n    logging:\n      driver: none\n\nvolumes:\n  data:\n  node_modules:\n```\n",

        "content": "\n## Introduction\n\nPayload has built-in security best practices that can be configured to your application-specific needs.\n\n### Limit Failed Login Attempts\n\nSet the max number of failed login attempts before a user account is locked out for a period of time. Set the `maxLoginAttempts` on the collections that feature Authentication to a reasonable but low number for your users to get in. Use the `lockTime` to set a number in milliseconds from the time a user fails their last allowed attempt that a user must wait to try again.\n\n### Rate Limiting Requests\n\nTo prevent DDoS, brute-force, and similar attacks, you can set IP-based rate limits so that once a certain threshold of requests has been hit by a single IP, further requests from the same IP will be ignored. The Payload config `rateLimit` property accepts an object with the following properties:\n\n| Option           | Description                                                                                                             |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`window`**     | Time in milliseconds to track requests per IP. Defaults to `900000` (15 minutes).                                        |\n| **`max`**        | Number of requests served from a single IP before limiting. Defaults to `500`.                                          |\n| **`skip`**       | Express middleware function that can return true (or promise resulting in true) that will bypass limit.                 |\n| **`trustProxy`** | True or false, to enable to allow requests to pass through a proxy such as a load balancer or an `nginx` reverse proxy. |\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Warning:</strong>\n  <br />\n  Very commonly, NodeJS apps are served behind `nginx` reverse proxies and similar. If you use\n  rate-limiting while you're behind a proxy, <strong>all</strong> IP addresses from everyone that\n  uses your API will appear as if they are from a local origin (127.0.0.1), and your users will get\n  rate-limited very quickly without cause. If you plan to host your app behind a proxy, make sure\n  you set <strong>trustProxy</strong> to <strong>true</strong>.\n</Banner>\n\n### Max Depth\n\nQuerying a collection and automatically including related documents via `depth` incurs a performance cost. Also, it's possible that your configs may have circular relationships, meaning scenarios where an infinite amount of relationships might populate back and forth until your server times out and crashes. You can prevent any potential of depth-related issues by setting a `maxDepth` property on your Payload config.. The maximum allowed depth should be as small as possible without interrupting dev experience, and it defaults to `10`.\n\n### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n\nCSRF prevention will verify the authenticity of each request to your API to prevent a malicious action from another site from authorized users. See how to configure CSRF [here](../authentication/overview#csrf-protection).\n\n### Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)\n\nTo securely allow headless operation you will need to configure the allowed origins for requests to be able to use the Payload API. You can see how to set CORS as well as other payload configuration settings [here](../configuration/overview)\n\n### Limiting GraphQL Complexity\n\nBecause GraphQL gives the power of query writing outside a server's control, someone with bad intentions might write a maliciously complex query and bog down your server. To prevent resource-intensive GraphQL requests, Payload provides a way specify complexity limits which are based on a complexity score that is calculated for each request.\n\nAny GraphQL request that is calculated to be too expensive is rejected. On the Payload config, in `graphQL` you can set the `maxComplexity` value as an integer. For reference, the default complexity value for each added field is 1, and all `relationship` and `upload` fields are assigned a value of 10.\n\nIf you do not need GraphQL it is advised that you disable it altogether with the Payload config by setting `graphQL.disable: true`. Should you wish to enable GraphQL again, you can remove this property or set it `false`, any time. By turning it off, Payload will bypass creating schemas from your collections and will not register the express route.\n\n### Malicious File Uploads\n\nPayload does not execute uploaded files on the server, but depending on your setup it may be used to transmit and store potentially dangerous files. If your configuration allows file uploads there is the potential that a bad actor uploads a malicious file that is then served to other users. Consider the following ways to mitigate the risks.\n\nFirst, enable email [verification](../authentication/config#email-verification) when users are allowed to register new accounts and add other bot prevention services.\n\nReview that `create` and `update` access on file upload collections are as restrictive as your application needs allow. Consider limiting `read` access of uploaded user's files and how you might limit user uploaded files from being served outside of Payload.\n\nYou can also add a [3rd party library](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav) to scan files in a [hook](../hooks/collections) or have antivirus software in place.\n",

      {
        "content": "\n### Introduction\n\nPayload comes ready to send your application's email. Whether you simply need built-in password reset\nemail to work or you want customers to get an order confirmation email, you're almost there. Payload makes use of\n[NodeMailer](https://nodemailer.com) for email and won't get in your way for those already familiar.\n\nFor email to send from your Payload server, some configuration is required. The settings you provide will be set\nin the `email` property object of your payload init call. Payload will make use of the transport that you have configured for it for things like reset password or verifying new user accounts and email send methods are available to you as well on your payload instance.\n\n### Configuration\n\n**Three ways to set it up**\n\n1. **Default**: When email is not needed, a mock email handler will be created and used when nothing is provided. This is ideal for development environments and can be changed later when ready to [go to production](../production/deployment).\n1. **Recommended**: Set the `transportOptions` and Payload will do the set up for you.\n1. **Advanced**: The `transport` object can be assigned a nodemailer transport object set up in your server scripts and given for Payload to use.\n\nThe following options are configurable in the `email` property object as part of the options object when calling payload.init().\n\n| Option                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`fromName`** \\*        | The name part of the From field that will be seen on the delivered email                                                                                                                     |\n| **`fromAddress`** \\*     | The email address part of the From field that will be used when delivering email                                                                                                             |\n| **`transport`**          | The NodeMailer transport object for when you want to do it yourself, not needed when transportOptions is set                                                                                 |\n| **`transportOptions`**   | An object that configures the transporter that Payload will create. For all the available options see the [NodeMailer documentation](https://nodemailer.com) or see the examples below |\n| **`logMockCredentials`** | If set to true and no transport/transportOptions, ethereal credentials will be logged to console on startup                                                                                  |\n\n_\\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._\n\n### Use SMTP\n\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) options can be passed in using the `transportOptions` object on the `email` options. See the [NodeMailer SMTP documentation](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/) for more information, including details on when `secure` should and should not be set to `true`.\n\n**Example email options using SMTP:**\n\n```ts\npayload.init({\n  email: {\n    transportOptions: {\n      host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,\n      auth: {\n        user: process.env.SMTP_USER,\n        pass: process.env.SMTP_PASS,\n      },\n      port: Number(process.env.SMTP_HOST),\n      secure: Number(process.env.SMTP_PORT) === 465, // true for port 465, false (the default) for 587 and others\n      requireTLS: true,\n    },\n    fromName: 'hello',\n    fromAddress: 'hello@example.com',\n  },\n  // ...\n})\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  It is best practice to avoid saving credentials or API keys directly in your code, use\n  [environment variables](../configuration/overview#using-environment-variables-in-your-config).\n</Banner>\n\n### Use an email service\n\nMany third party mail providers are available and offer benefits beyond basic SMTP. As an example, your payload init could look like this if you wanted to use SendGrid.com, though the same approach would work for any other [NodeMailer transports](https://nodemailer.com/transports/) shown here or provided by another third party.\n\n```ts\nimport payload from 'payload'\nimport nodemailerSendgrid from 'nodemailer-sendgrid'\n\nconst sendGridAPIKey = process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY\n\npayload.init({\n  ...(sendGridAPIKey\n    ? {\n        email: {\n          transportOptions: nodemailerSendgrid({\n            apiKey: sendGridAPIKey,\n          }),\n          fromName: 'Admin',\n          fromAddress: 'admin@example.com',\n        },\n      }\n    : {}),\n})\n```\n\n### Use a custom NodeMailer transport\n\nTo take full control of the mail transport you may wish to use `nodemailer.createTransport()` on your server and provide it to Payload init.\n\n```ts\nimport payload from 'payload'\nimport nodemailer from 'nodemailer'\n\nconst payload = require('payload')\nconst nodemailer = require('nodemailer')\n\nconst transport = await nodemailer.createTransport({\n  host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,\n  port: 587,\n  auth: {\n    user: process.env.SMTP_USER,\n    pass: process.env.SMTP_PASS,\n  },\n})\n\npayload.init({\n  email: {\n    fromName: 'Admin',\n    fromAddress: 'admin@example.com',\n    transport,\n  },\n  // ...\n})\n```\n\n### Sending Mail\n\nWith a working transport you can call it anywhere you have access to payload by calling `payload.sendEmail(message)`. The `message` will contain the `to`, `subject` and `email` or `text` for the email being sent. To see all available message configuration options see [NodeMailer](https://nodemailer.com/message).\n\n### Mock transport\n\nBy default, Payload uses a mock implementation that only sends mail to the [ethereal](https://ethereal.email) capture service that will never reach a user's inbox. While in development you may wish to make use of the captured messages which is why the payload output during server output helpfully logs this out on the server console.\n\nTo see ethereal credentials, add `logMockCredentials: true` to the email options. This will cause them to be logged to console on startup.\n\n```ts\npayload.init({\n  email: {\n    fromName: 'Admin',\n    fromAddress: 'admin@example.com',\n    logMockCredentials: true, // Optional\n  },\n  // ...\n})\n```\n\n**Console output when starting payload with a mock email instance and logMockCredentials: true**\n\n```\n[06:37:21] INFO  (payload): Starting Payload...\n[06:37:22] INFO  (payload): Payload Demo Initialized\n[06:37:22] INFO  (payload): listening on 3000...\n[06:37:22] INFO  (payload): Connected to MongoDB server successfully!\n[06:37:23] INFO  (payload): E-mail configured with mock configuration\n[06:37:23] INFO  (payload): Log into mock email provider at https://ethereal.email\n[06:37:23] INFO  (payload): Mock email account username: hhav5jw7doo4euev@ethereal.email\n[06:37:23] INFO  (payload): Mock email account password: VNdGcvDZeyEhtuPBqf\n```\n\nThe mock email handler is used when payload is started with neither `transport` or `transportOptions` to know how to deliver email.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  The randomly generated email account username and password will be different each time the Payload\n  server starts.\n</Banner>\n\n### Using multiple mail providers\n\nPayload supports the use of a single transporter of email, but there is nothing stopping you from having more. Consider a use case where sending bulk email is handled differently than transactional email and could be done using a [hook](../hooks/overview).\n",

        "content": "\nWhile building your own custom functionality into Payload, like plugins, hooks, access control functions, custom views, GraphQL queries / mutations, or anything else, you may benefit from generating your own TypeScript types dynamically from your Payload config itself.\n\n### Types generation script\n\nRun the following command in a Payload project to generate types based on your Payload config:\n\n```\npayload generate:types\n```\n\nYou can run this command whenever you need to regenerate your types, and then you can use these types in your Payload code directly.\n\n### Disable declare statement\n\nBy default, `generate:types` will add a `declare` statement to your types file, which automatically enables type inference within Payload.\n\nIf you are using your `payload-types.ts` file in other repos, though, it might be better to disable this `declare` statement, so that you don't get any TS errors in projects that use your Payload types, but do not have Payload installed.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  typescript: {\n    declare: false, // defaults to true if not set\n  },\n}\n```\n\nIf you do disable the `declare` pattern, you'll need to manually add a `declare` statement to your code in order for Payload types to be recognized. Here's an example showing how to declare your types in your `payload.config.ts` file:\n\n```ts\nimport { Config } from './payload-types'\n\ndeclare module 'payload' {\n  export interface GeneratedTypes extends Config {}\n}\n```\n\n### Custom output file path\n\nYou can specify where you want your types to be generated by adding a property to your Payload config:\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n\ttypescript: {\n    // defaults to: path.resolve(__dirname, './payload-types.ts')\n\t\toutputFile: path.resolve(__dirname, './generated-types.ts'),\n\t},\n}\n```\n\nThe above example places your types next to your Payload config itself as the file `generated-types.ts`.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nFor example, let's look at the following simple Payload config:\n\n```ts\nconst config: Config = {\n  serverURL: process.env.PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL,\n  admin: {\n    user: 'users',\n  }\n  collections: [\n    {\n      slug: 'users',\n      fields: [\n        {\n          name: 'name',\n          type: 'text',\n          required: true,\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      slug: 'posts',\n      admin: {\n        useAsTitle: 'title',\n      },\n      fields: [\n        {\n          name: 'title',\n          type: 'text',\n        },\n        {\n          name: 'author',\n          type: 'relationship',\n          relationTo: 'users',\n        },\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nBy generating types, we'll end up with a file containing the following two TypeScript interfaces:\n\n```ts\nexport interface User {\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  email?: string\n  resetPasswordToken?: string\n  resetPasswordExpiration?: string\n  loginAttempts?: number\n  lockUntil?: string\n}\n\nexport interface Post {\n  id: string\n  title?: string\n  author?: string | User\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Field Interfaces\n\nFor `array`, `block`, `group` and named `tab` fields, you can generate top level reusable interfaces. The following group field config:\n\n```ts\n{\n  type: 'group',\n  name: 'meta',\n  interfaceName: 'SharedMeta', <-- here!!\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'title',\n      type: 'text',\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'description',\n      type: 'text',\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nwill generate:\n\n```ts\n// a top level reusable interface!!\nexport interface SharedMeta {\n  title?: string\n  description?: string\n}\n\n// example usage inside collection interface\nexport interface Collection1 {\n  // ...other fields\n  meta?: SharedMeta\n}\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Naming Collisions</strong>\n  <br />\n  Since these types are hoisted to the top level, you need to be aware that naming collisions can\n  occur. For example, if you have a collection with the name of `Meta` and you also create a\n  interface with the name `Meta` they will collide. It is recommended to scope your interfaces by\n  appending the field type to the end, i.e. `MetaGroup` or similar.\n</Banner>\n\n### Using your types\n\nNow that your types have been generated, payloads local API will now be typed. It is common for users to want to use this in their frontend code, we recommend generating them with payload and then copying the file over to your frontend codebase. This is the simplest way to get your types into your frontend codebase.\n\n#### Adding an NPM script\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Important</strong>\n  <br />\n  Payload needs to be able to find your config to generate your types.\n</Banner>\n\nPayload will automatically try and locate your config, but might not always be able to find it. For example, if you are working in a `/src` directory or similar, you need to tell Payload where to find your config manually by using an environment variable. If this applies to you, you can create an NPM script to make generating your types easier.\n\nTo add an NPM script to generate your types and show Payload where to find your config, open your `package.json` and update the `scripts` property to the following:\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"generate:types\": \"PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH=src/payload.config.ts payload generate:types\",\n  },\n}\n```\n\nNow you can run `yarn generate:types` to easily generate your types.\n",

        "content": "\nPayload comes with a built-in Plugins infrastructure that allows developers to build their own modular and easily reusable sets of functionality.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  Because we rely on a simple config-based structure, Payload plugins simply take in a user's\n  existing config and return a modified config with new fields, hooks, collections, admin views, or\n  anything else you can think of.\n</Banner>\n\nWriting plugins is no more complex than writing regular JavaScript. If you know how [spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) works and are up to speed with Payload concepts, writing a plugin will be a breeze.\n\n**Example use cases:**\n\n- Automatically sync data from a specific collection to HubSpot or a similar CRM when data is added or changes\n- Add password-protection functionality to certain documents\n- Add a full e-commerce backend to any Payload app\n- Add custom reporting views to Payload's admin panel\n- Encrypt specific collections' data\n- Add a full form builder implementation\n- Integrate all `upload`-enabled collections with a third-party file host like S3 or Cloudinary\n- Add custom endpoints or GraphQL queries / mutations with any type of custom functionality that you can think of\n\n### How to install plugins\n\nThe base Payload config allows for a `plugins` property which takes an `array` of [`Plugins`](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/packages/payload/src/config/types.ts).\n\n```js\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\n// note: these plugins are not real (yet?)\nimport addLastModified from 'payload-add-last-modified'\nimport passwordProtect from 'payload-password-protect'\nimport { mongooseAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-mongodb'\nimport { postgresAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-postgres'\n\nimport { viteBundler } from '@payloadcms/bundler-vite'\nimport { webpackBundler } from '@payloadcms/bundler-webpack'\n\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  bundler: webpackBundler() // or viteBundler(),\n  collections: [\n    {\n      slug: 'pages',\n      fields: [\n        {\n          name: 'title',\n          type: 'text',\n          required: true,\n        },\n        {\n          name: 'content',\n          type: 'richText',\n          required: true,\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n  db: mongooseAdapter({}) // or postgresAdapter({})\n  plugins: [\n    // Many plugins require options to be passed.\n    // In the following example, we call the function\n    // and pass it options accordingly\n    passwordProtect(['pages']),\n\n    // This plugin takes no options and just\n    // needs to be passed directly\n    addLastModified,\n\n    // ..\n    // To understand how to use the plugins you're interested in,\n    // consult their corresponding documentation\n  ],\n})\n\nexport default config\n```\n\n#### When Plugins are initialized\n\nPayload Plugins are executed _after_ the incoming config is validated, but before it is sanitized and had default options merged in.\n\nAfter all plugins are executed, the full config with all plugins will be sanitized.\n\n## Simple example\n\nHere is an example for how to automatically add a `lastModifiedBy` field to all Payload collections using a Plugin written in TypeScript.\n\n```ts\nimport { Config, Plugin } from 'payload/config'\n\nconst addLastModified: Plugin = (incomingConfig: Config): Config => {\n  // Find all incoming auth-enabled collections\n  // so we can create a lastModifiedBy relationship field\n  // to all auth collections\n  const authEnabledCollections = incomingConfig.collections.filter((collection) =>\n    Boolean(collection.auth),\n  )\n\n  // Spread the existing config\n  const config: Config = {\n    ...incomingConfig,\n    collections: incomingConfig.collections.map((collection) => {\n      // Spread each item that we are modifying,\n      // and add our new field - complete with\n      // hooks and proper admin UI config\n      return {\n        ...collection,\n        fields: [\n          ...collection.fields,\n          {\n            name: 'lastModifiedBy',\n            type: 'relationship',\n            relationTo: authEnabledCollections.map(({ slug }) => slug),\n            hooks: {\n              beforeChange: [\n                ({ req }) => ({\n                  value: req?.user?.id,\n                  relationTo: req?.user?.collection,\n                }),\n              ],\n            },\n            admin: {\n              position: 'sidebar',\n              readOnly: true,\n            },\n          },\n        ],\n      }\n    }),\n  }\n\n  return config\n}\n\nexport default addLastModified\n```\n\n### Available Plugins\n\nYou can discover existing plugins by browsing the `payload-plugin` topic on [GitHub](https://github.com/topics/payload-plugin).\n\nFor maintainers building plugins for others to use, please add the topic to help others find it. If you would like one to be built by the core Payload team, [open a Feature Request](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/discussions) in our GitHub Discussions board. We would be happy to review your code and maybe feature you and your plugin where appropriate.\n",

Instead of hard-coding a new form into your website or application every time you need one, admins can simply define the schema for each form they need on-the-fly, and your front-end can map over this schema, render its own UI components, and match your brand's design system.\n\nAll form submissions are stored directly in your database and are managed directly from the admin panel. When forms are submitted, you can display a custom on-screen confirmation message to the user or redirect them to a dedicated confirmation page. You can even send dynamic, personalized emails derived from the form's data. For example, you may want to send a confirmation email to the user who submitted the form, and also send a notification email to your team.\n\nForms can be as simple or complex as you need, from a basic contact form, to a multi-step lead generation engine, or even a donation form that processes payment. You may not need to reach for third-party services like HubSpot or Mailchimp for this, but instead use your own first-party tooling, built directly into your own application.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  This plugin is completely open-source and the [source code can be found here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/plugin-form-builder). If you need help, check out our [Community Help](https://payloadcms.com/community-help). If you think you've found a bug, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues/new?assignees=&labels=plugin%3A%20form-builder&template=bug_report.md&title=plugin-form-builder%3A) with as much detail as possible.\n</Banner>\n\n##### Core Features\n\n- Build completely dynamic forms directly from the admin panel for a variety of use cases\n- Render forms on your front-end using your own UI components and match your brand's design system\n- Send dynamic, personalized emails upon form submission to multiple recipients, derived from the form's data\n- Display a custom confirmation message or automatically redirect upon form submission\n- Build dynamic prices based on form input to use for payment processing (optional)\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the plugin using any JavaScript package manager like [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), [NPM](https://npmjs.com), or [PNPM](https://pnpm.io):\n\n```bash\nyarn add @payloadcms/plugin-form-builder\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nIn the `plugins` array of your [Payload config](../configuration/overview), call the plugin with [options](#options):\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport formBuilder from '@payloadcms/plugin-form-builder'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    {\n      slug: 'pages',\n      fields: [],\n    },\n  ],\n  plugins: [\n    formBuilder({\n      // see below for a list of available options\n    })\n  ],\n})\n\nexport default config\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### `fields` (option)\n\nThe `fields` property is an object of field types to allow your admin editors to build forms with. To override default settings, pass either a boolean value or a partial [Payload Block](../fields/blocks#block-configs) _keyed to the block's slug_. See [Fields](#fields) for more details.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nformBuilder({\n  // ...\n  fields: {\n    text: true,\n    textarea: true,\n    select: true,\n    email: true,\n    state: true,\n    country: true,\n    checkbox: true,\n    number: true,\n    message: true,\n    payment: false\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### `redirectRelationships`\n\nThe `redirectRelationships` property is an array of collection slugs that, when enabled, are populated as options in the form's `redirect` field. This field is used to redirect the user to a dedicated confirmation page upon form submission (optional).\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nformBuilder({\n  // ...\n  redirectRelationships: ['pages']\n})\n```\n\n#### `beforeEmail`\n\nThe `beforeEmail` property is a [beforeChange](../hooks/globals#beforechange) hook that is called just after emails are prepared, but before they are sent. This is a great place to inject your own HTML template to add custom styles.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nformBuilder({\n  // ...\n  beforeEmail: (emailsToSend) => {\n    // modify the emails in any way before they are sent\n    return emails.map((email) => ({\n      ...email,\n      html: email.html, // transform the html in any way you'd like (maybe wrap it in an html template?)\n    }))\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### `formOverrides`\n\nOverride anything on the `forms` collection by sending a [Payload Collection Config](../configuration/collections) to the `formOverrides` property.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nformBuilder({\n  // ...\n  formOverrides: {\n    slug: \"contact-forms\",\n    access: {\n      read: () => true,\n      update: () => false,\n    },\n    fields: [\n      {\n        name: \"custom-field\",\n        type: \"text\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### `formSubmissionOverrides`\n\nOverride anything on the `form-submissions` collection by sending a [Payload Collection Config](../configuration/collections) to the `formSubmissionOverrides` property.\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  By default, this plugin relies on [Payload access control](../access-control/collections) to restrict the `update` and `read` operations on the `form-submissions` collection. This is because _anyone_ should be able to create a form submission, even from a public-facing website, but _no one_ should be able to update a submission one it has been created, or read a submission unless they have permission. You can override this behavior or any other property as needed.\n</Banner>\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nformBuilder({\n  // ...\n  formSubmissionOverrides: {\n    slug: \"leads\",\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### `handlePayment`\n\nThe `handlePayment` property is a [beforeChange](<[beforeChange](../hooks/globals#beforechange)>) hook that is called upon form submission. You can integrate into any third-party payment processing API here to accept payment based on form input. You can use the `getPaymentTotal` function to calculate the total cost after all conditions have been applied. This is only applicable if the form has enabled the `payment` field.\n\nFirst import the utility function. This will execute all of the price conditions that you have set in your form's `payment` field and returns the total price.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nimport { getPaymentTotal } from '@payloadcms/plugin-form-builder';\n```\n\nThen in your plugin's config:\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nformBuilder({\n  // ...\n  handlePayment: async ({ form, submissionData }) => {\n    // first calculate the price\n    const paymentField =  form.fields?.find((field) => field.blockType === 'payment');\n    const price = getPaymentTotal({\n      basePrice: paymentField.basePrice,\n      priceConditions: paymentField.priceConditions,\n      fieldValues: submissionData,\n    });\n    // then asynchronously process the payment here\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Fields\n\nEach field represents a form input. To override default settings pass either a boolean value or a partial [Payload Block](../fields/blocks) _keyed to the block's slug_. See [Field Overrides](#field-overrides) for more details on how to do this.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  \"Fields\" here is in reference to the _fields to build forms with_, not to be confused with the _fields of a collection_ which are set via `formOverrides.fields`.\n</Banner>\n\n#### Text\n\nMaps to a `text` input in your front-end.

See below for more details. |\n\n##### Price Conditions\n\nEach of the `priceConditions` are executed by the `getPaymentTotal` utility that this plugin provides. You can call this function in your `handlePayment` callback to dynamically calculate the total price of a form upon submission based on the user's input. For example, you could create a price condition that says \"if the user selects 'yes' for this checkbox, add $10 to the total price\".\n\n| property | type | description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `fieldToUse` | relationship | The field to use to determine the price. |\n| `condition` | string | The condition to use to determine the price. |\n| `valueForOperator` | string | The value to use for the operator. |\n| `operator` | string | The operator to use to determine the price. |\n| `valueType` | string | The type of value to use to determine the price. |\n| `value` | string | The value to use to determine the price. |\n\n#### Field Overrides\n\nYou can provide your own custom fields by passing a new [Payload Block](../fields/blocks#block-configs) object into `fields`. You can override or extend any existing fields by first importing the `fields` from the plugin:\n\n```ts\nimport { fields } from '@payloadcms/plugin-form-builder'\n```\n\nThen merging it into your own custom field:\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nformBuilder({\n  // ...\n  fields: {\n    text: {\n      ...fields.text,\n      labels: {\n        singular: \"Custom Text Field\",\n        plural: \"Custom Text Fields\",\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Email\n\nThis plugin relies on the [email configuration](../email/overview) defined in your `payload.init()`. It will read from your config and attempt to send your emails using the credentials provided.\n\n## TypeScript\n\nAll types can be directly imported:\n\n```js\nimport {\n  PluginConfig,\n  Form,\n  FormSubmission,\n  FieldsConfig,\n  BeforePayment,\n  BeforeEmail,\n  HandlePayment,\n  ...\n} from \"@payloadcms/plugin-form-builder/types\";\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nThe [Examples Directory](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples) contains an official [Form Builder Plugin Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/form-builder) which demonstrates exactly how to configure this plugin in Payload and implement it on your front-end. We've also included an in-depth walk-through of how to build a form from scratch in our [Form Builder Plugin Blog Post](https://payloadcms.com/blog/create-custom-forms-with-the-official-form-builder-plugin).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nBelow are some common troubleshooting tips. To help other developers, please contribute to this section as you troubleshoot your own application.\n\n##### SendGrid 403 Forbidden Error\n\n- If you are using [SendGrid Link Branding](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-link-branding) to remove the \"via sendgrid.net\" part of your email, you must also setup [Domain Authentication](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication). This means you can only send emails from an address on this domain — so the `from` addresses in your form submission emails **_cannot_** be anything other than `something@your_domain.com`. This means that from `{{email}}` will not work, but `website@your_domain.com` will. You can still send the form's email address in the body of the email.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![screenshot 1](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-form-builder/blob/main/images/screenshot-1.jpg?raw=true)\n<br />\n![screenshot 2](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-form-builder/blob/main/images/screenshot-2.jpg?raw=true)\n<br />\n![screenshot 3](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-form-builder/blob/main/images/screenshot-3.jpg?raw=true)\n<br />\n![screenshot 4](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-form-builder/blob/main/images/screenshot-4.jpg?raw=true)\n<br />\n![screenshot 5](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-form-builder/blob/main/images/screenshot-5.jpg?raw=true)\n<br />\n![screenshot 6](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-form-builder/blob/main/images/screenshot-6.jpg?raw=true)\n",

It does so by adding a\nnew `parent` field onto each of your documents that, when selected, attaches itself to the parent's tree. When you edit\nthe great-great-grandparent of a document, for instance, all of its descendants are recursively updated. This is an\nextremely powerful way of achieving hierarchy within a collection, such as parent/child relationship between pages.\n\nDocuments also receive a new `breadcrumbs` field. Once a parent is assigned, these breadcrumbs are populated based on\neach ancestor up the tree. Breadcrumbs allow you to dynamically generate labels and URLs based on the document's\nposition in the hierarchy. Even if the slug of a parent document changes, or the entire tree is nested another level\ndeep, changes will cascade down the entire tree and all breadcrumbs will reflect those changes.\n\nWith this pattern you can perform whatever side-effects your applications needs on even the most deeply nested\ndocuments. For example, you could easily add a custom `fullTitle` field onto each document and inject the parent's title\nonto it, such as \"Parent Title > Child Title\". This would allow you to then perform searches and filters based on _that_\nfield instead of the original title. This is especially useful if you happen to have two documents with identical titles\nbut different parents.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  This plugin is completely open-source and the [source code can be found here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/plugin-nested-docs). If you need help, check out our [Community Help](https://payloadcms.com/community-help). If you think you've found a bug, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues/new?assignees=&labels=plugin%3A%20nested-docs&template=bug_report.md&title=plugin-nested-docs%3A) with as much detail as possible.\n</Banner>\n\n##### Core features\n\n- Automatically adds a `parent` relationship field to each document\n- Allows for parent/child relationships between documents within the same collection\n- Recursively updates all descendants when a parent is changed\n- Automatically populates a `breadcrumbs` field with all ancestors up the tree\n- Dynamically generate labels and URLs for each breadcrumb\n- Supports localization\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the plugin using any JavaScript package manager like [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), [NPM](https://npmjs.com),\nor [PNPM](https://pnpm.io):\n\n```bash\n  yarn add @payloadcms/plugin-nested-docs\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nIn the `plugins` array of your [Payload config](../configuration/overview), call the plugin\nwith [options](#options):\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport nestedDocs from '@payloadcms/plugin-nested-docs'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    {\n      slug: 'pages',\n      fields: [\n        {\n          name: 'title',\n          type: 'text',\n        },\n        {\n          name: 'slug',\n          type: 'text',\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n  plugins: [\n    nestedDocs({\n      collections: ['pages'],\n      generateLabel: (_, doc) => doc.title,\n      generateURL: (docs) => docs.reduce((url, doc) => `${url}/${doc.slug}`, ''),\n    }),\n  ],\n})\n\nexport default config\n```\n\n### Fields\n\n#### Parent\n\nThe `parent` relationship field is automatically added to every document which allows editors to choose another document\nfrom the same collection to act as the direct parent.\n\n#### Breadcrumbs\n\nThe `breadcrumbs` field is an array which dynamically populates all parent relationships of a document up to the top\nlevel and stores the following fields.\n\n| Field   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `label` | The label of the breadcrumb. This field is automatically set to either the `collection.admin.useAsTitle` (if defined) or is set to the `ID` of the document. You can also dynamically define the `label` by passing a function to the options property of [`generateLabel`](#generateLabel). |\n| `url`   | The URL of the breadcrumb. By default, this field is undefined. You can manually define this field by passing a property called function to the plugin options property of [`generateURL`](#generateURL).                                                                                    |\n\n### Options\n\n#### `collections`\n\nAn array of collections slugs to enable nested docs.\n\n#### `generateLabel`\n\nEach `breadcrumb` has a required `label` field. By default, its value will be set to the collection's `admin.useAsTitle`\nor fallback the the `ID` of the document.\n\nYou can also pass a function to dynamically set the `label` of your breadcrumb.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nnestedDocs({\n  //...\n  generateLabel: (_, doc) => doc.title // NOTE: 'title' is a hypothetical field\n})\n```\n\nThe function takes two arguments and returns a string:\n\n| Argument | Type     | Description                                  |\n|----------|----------|----------------------------------------------|\n| `docs`   | `Array`  | An array of the breadcrumbs up to that point |\n| `doc`    | `Object` | The current document being edited            |\n\n#### `generateURL`\n\nA function that allows you to dynamically generate each breadcrumb `url`. Each `breadcrumb` has an optional `url` field\nwhich is undefined by default. For example, you might want to format a full URL to contain all breadcrumbs up to\nthat point, like `/about-us/company/our-team`.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nnestedDocs({\n  //...\n  generateURL: (docs) => docs.reduce((url, doc) => `${url}/${doc.slug}`, ''), // NOTE: 'slug' is a hypothetical field\n})\n```\n\n| Argument | Type     | Description                                  |\n|----------|----------|----------------------------------------------|\n| `docs`   | `Array`  | An array of the breadcrumbs up to that point |\n| `doc`    | `Object` | The current document being edited            |\n\n#### `parentFieldSlug`\n\nWhen defined, the `parent` field will not be provided for you automatically, and instead, expects you to add your\nown `parent` field to each collection manually. This gives you complete control over where you put the field in your\nadmin dashboard, etc. Set this property to the `name` of your custom field.\n\n#### `breadcrumbsFieldSlug`\n\nWhen defined, the `breadcrumbs` field will not be provided for you, and instead, expects you to add your\nown `breadcrumbs` field to each collection manually. Set this property to the `name` of your custom field.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If you opt out of automatically being provided a `parent` or `breadcrumbs` field, you need to make sure that both fields are placed at the top-level of your document. They cannot exist within any nested data structures like a `group`, `array`, or `blocks`.\n</Banner>\n\n## Overrides\n\nYou can also extend the built-in `parent` and `breadcrumbs` fields per collection by using the `createParentField`\nand `createBreadcrumbField` methods. They will merge your customizations overtop the plugin's base field configurations.\n\n```ts\nimport { CollectionConfig } from \"payload/types\";\nimport { createParentField } from \"@payloadcms/plugin-nested-docs/fields\";\nimport { createBreadcrumbsField } from \"@payloadcms/plugin-nested-docs/fields\";\n\nconst examplePageConfig: CollectionConfig = {\n  slug: \"pages\",\n  fields: [\n    createParentField(\n      // First argument is equal to the slug of the collection\n      // that the field references\n      \"pages\",\n\n      // Second argument is equal to field overrides that you specify,\n      // which will be merged into the base parent field config\n      {\n        admin: {\n          position: \"sidebar\",\n        },\n        // Note: if you override the `filterOptions` of the `parent` field,\n        // be sure to continue to prevent the document from referencing itself as the parent like this:\n        // filterOptions: ({ id }) => ({ id: {not_equals: id }})`\n      }\n    ),\n    createBreadcrumbsField(\n      // First argument is equal to the slug of the collection\n      // that the field references\n      \"pages\",\n\n      // Argument equal to field overrides that you specify,\n      // which will be merged into the base `breadcrumbs` field config\n      {\n        label: \"Page Breadcrumbs\",\n      }\n    ),\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If overriding the `name` of either `breadcrumbs` or `parent` fields, you must specify the `breadcrumbsFieldSlug` or `parentFieldSlug` respectively.\n</Banner>\n\n## Localization\n\nThis plugin supports localization by default. If the `localization` property is set in your Payload config,\nthe `breadcrumbs` field is automatically localized. For more details on how localization works in Payload, see\nthe [Localization](../configuration/localization) docs.\n\n## TypeScript\n\nAll types can be directly imported:\n\n```ts\nimport { PluginConfig, GenerateURL, GenerateLabel } from '@payloadcms/plugin-nested-docs/types'\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nThe [Examples Directory](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples) contains an\nofficial [Nested Docs Plugin Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/nested-docs) which\ndemonstrates exactly how to configure this plugin in Payload and implement it on your front-end.\nThe [Templates Directory](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates) also contains an\nofficial [Website Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates/website)\nand [E-commerce Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates/ecommerce), both of which use this\nplugin.\n",

It does so by adding a `redirects` collection to your config that allows you specify a redirect from one URL to another. Your front-end application can use this data to automatically redirect users to the correct page using proper HTTP status codes. This is useful for SEO, indexing, and search engine ranking when re-platforming or when changing your URL structure.\n\nFor example, if you have a page at `/about` and you want to change it to `/about-us`, you can create a redirect from the old page to the new one, then you can use this data to write HTTP redirects into your front-end application. This will ensure that users are redirected to the correct page without penalty because search engines are notified of the change at the request level. This is a very lightweight plugin that will allow you to integrate managed redirects for any front-end framework.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  This plugin is completely open-source and the [source code can be found here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/plugin-redirects).

It does so by creating a new `search` collection that is indexed in the database then saving a static copy of each of your documents using only search-critical data. Search records are automatically created, synced, and deleted behind-the-scenes as you manage your application's documents.\n\nFor example, if you have a posts collection that is extremely large and complex, this would allow you to sync just the title, excerpt, and slug of each post so you can query on _that_ instead of the original post directly. Search records are static, so querying them also has the significant advantage of bypassing any hooks that may present be on the original documents. You define exactly what data is synced, and you can even modify or fallback this data before it is saved on a per-document basis.\n\nTo query search results, use all the existing Payload APIs that you are already familiar with. You can also prioritize search results by setting a custom priority for each collection. For example, you may want to list blog posts before pages. Or you may want one specific post to always take appear first. Search records are given a `priority` field that can be used as the `?sort=` parameter in your queries.\n\nThis plugin is a great way to implement a fast, immersive search experience such as a search bar in a front-end application. Many applications may not need the power and complexity of a third-party service like Algolia or ElasticSearch. This plugin provides a first-party alternative that is easy to set up and runs entirely on your own database.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  This plugin is completely open-source and the [source code can be found here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/plugin-search). If you need help, check out our [Community Help](https://payloadcms.com/community-help). If you think you've found a bug, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues/new?assignees=&labels=plugin%3A%20search&template=bug_report.md&title=plugin-search%3A) with as much detail as possible.\n</Banner>\n\n##### Core Features\n\n- Automatically adds an indexed `search` collection to your database\n- Automatically creates, syncs, and deletes search records as you manage your documents\n- Saves only search-critical data that you define (e.g. title, excerpt, etc.)\n- Allows you to query search results using first-party Payload APIs\n- Allows you to query documents without triggering any of their underlying hooks\n- Allows you to easily prioritize search results by collection or document\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the plugin using any JavaScript package manager like [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), [NPM](https://npmjs.com), or [PNPM](https://pnpm.io):\n\n```bash\n  yarn add @payloadcms/plugin-search\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nIn the `plugins` array of your [Payload config](../configuration/overview), call the plugin with [options](#options):\n\n```js\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport search from '@payloadcms/plugin-search'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    {\n      slug: 'pages',\n      fields: [],\n    },\n    {\n      slug: 'posts',\n      fields: [],\n    },\n  ],\n  plugins: [\n    search({\n      collections: ['pages', 'posts'],\n      defaultPriorities: {\n        pages: 10,\n        posts: 20,\n      },\n    }),\n  ],\n})\n\nexport default config\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### `collections`\n\nThe `collections` property is an array of collection slugs to enable syncing to search. Enabled collections receive a `beforeChange` and `afterDelete` hook that creates, updates, and deletes its respective search record as it changes over time.\n\n#### `defaultPriorities`\n\nThis plugin automatically adds a `priority` field to the `search` collection that can be used as the `?sort=` parameter in your queries. For example, you may want to list blog posts before pages. Or you may want one specific post to always take appear first.\n\nThe `defaultPriorities` property is used to set a fallback `priority` on search records during the `create` operation. It accepts an object with keys that are your collection slugs and values that can either be a number or a function that returns a number. The function receives the `doc` as an argument, which is the document being created.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  searchPlugin({\n    defaultPriorities: {\n      pages: ({ doc }) => (doc.title.startsWith('Hello, world!') ? 1 : 10),\n      posts: 20,\n    },\n  }),\n}\n```\n\n#### `searchOverrides`\n\nThis plugin automatically creates the `search` collection, but you can override anything on this collection via the `searchOverrides` property. It accepts anything from the [Payload Collection Config](../configuration/collections) and merges it in with the default `search` collection config provided by the plugin.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  searchPlugin({\n    searchOverrides: {\n      slug: 'search-results',\n    },\n  }),\n}\n```\n\n#### `beforeSync`\n\nBefore creating or updating a search record, the `beforeSync` function runs. This is an [afterChange](../hooks/globals#afterchange) hook that allows you to modify the data or provide fallbacks before its search record is created or updated.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  searchPlugin({\n    beforeSync: ({ originalDoc, searchDoc }) => ({\n      ...searchDoc,\n      // Modify your docs in any way here, this can be async\n      excerpt: originalDoc?.excerpt || 'This is a fallback excerpt',\n    }),\n  }),\n}\n```\n\n#### `syncDrafts`\n\nWhen `syncDrafts` is true, draft documents will be synced to search. This is false by default. You must have [Payload Drafts](../versions/drafts) enabled for this to apply.\n\n#### `deleteDrafts`\n\nIf true, will delete documents from search whose status changes to draft. This is true by default. You must have [Payload Drafts](../versions/drafts) enabled for this to apply.\n\n## TypeScript\n\nAll types can be directly imported:\n\n```ts\nimport type { SearchConfig, BeforeSync } from '@payloadcms/plugin-search/types'\n```\n",

When enabled on your collections and globals, it adds a new `meta` field group containing `title`, `description`, and `image` by default. Your front-end application can then use this data to render meta tags however your application requires. For example, you would inject a `title` tag into the `<head>` of your page using `meta.title` as its content.\n\nAs users are editing documents within the admin panel, they have the option to \"auto-generate\" these fields. When clicked, this plugin will execute your own custom functions that re-generate the title, description, and image. This way you can build your own SEO writing assistance directly into your application. For example, you could append your site name onto the page title, or use the document's excerpt field as the description, or even integrate with some third-party API to generate the image using AI.\n\nTo help you visualize what your page might look like in a search engine, a preview is rendered on page just beneath the meta fields. This preview is updated in real-time as you edit your metadata. There are also visual indicators to help you write effective meta, such as a character counter for the title and description fields. You can even inject your own custom fields into the `meta` field group as your application requires, like `og:title` or `json-ld`. If you've ever used something like Yoast SEO, this plugin might feel very familiar.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  This plugin is completely open-source and the [source code can be found here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/plugin-seo).

Enabled collections receive a `meta` field which is an object of title, description, and image subfields.\n\n##### `globals`\n\nAn array of global slugs to enable SEO. Enabled globals receive a `meta` field which is an object of title, description, and image subfields.\n\n##### `fields`\n\nAn array of fields that allows you to inject your own custom fields onto the `meta` field group. The following fields are provided by default:\n\n  - `title`: text\n  - `description`: textarea\n  - `image`: upload (if an `uploadsCollection` is provided)\n  - `preview`: ui\n\n##### `uploadsCollection`\n\nSet the `uploadsCollection` to your application's upload-enabled collection slug. This is used to provide an `image` field on the `meta` field group.\n\n##### `tabbedUI`\n\nWhen the `tabbedUI` property is `true`, it appends an `SEO` tab onto your config using Payload's [Tabs Field](../fields/tabs). If your collection is not already tab-enabled, meaning the first field in your config is not of type `tabs`, then one will be created for you called `Content`. Defaults to `false`.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  If you wish to continue to use top-level or sidebar fields with `tabbedUI`, you must not let the default `Content` tab get created for you (see the note above). Instead, you must define the first field of your config with type `tabs` and place all other fields adjacent to this one.\n</Banner>\n\n##### `generateTitle`\n\nA function that allows you to return any meta title, including from document's content.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  seoPlugin({\n    generateTitle: ({ ...docInfo, doc, locale }) => `Website.com — ${doc?.title?.value}`,\n  })\n}\n```\n\n##### `generateDescription`\n\nA function that allows you to return any meta description, including from document's content.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  seoPlugin({\n    generateDescription: ({ ...docInfo, doc, locale }) => doc?.excerpt?.value\n  })\n}\n```\n\n##### `generateImage`\n\nA function that allows you to return any meta image, including from document's content.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  seoPlugin({\n    generateImage: ({ ...docInfo, doc, locale }) => doc?.featuredImage?.value\n  })\n}\n```\n\n##### `generateURL`\n\nA function called by the search preview component to display the actual URL of your page.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  seoPlugin({\n    generateURL: ({ ...docInfo, doc, locale }) => `https://yoursite.com/${collection?.slug}/${doc?.slug?.value}`\n  })\n}\n```\n\n#### `interfaceName`\n\nRename the meta group interface name that is generated for TypeScript and GraphQL.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\n{\n  // ...\n  seoPlugin({\n    interfaceName: 'customInterfaceNameSEO'\n  })\n}\n```\n\n#### `fieldOverrides`\n\nPass any valid field props to the base fields: Title, Description or Image.\n\n```ts\n// payload.config.ts\nseoPlugin({\n  // ...\n  fieldOverrides: {\n    title: {\n      required: true,\n    },\n    description: {\n      localized: true,\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## TypeScript\n\nAll types can be directly imported:\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  PluginConfig,\n  GenerateTitle,\n  GenerateDescription\n  GenerateURL\n} from '@payloadcms/plugin-seo/types';\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nThe [Templates Directory](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates) contains an official [Website Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates/website) and [E-commerce Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates/ecommerce) which demonstrates exactly how to configure this plugin in Payload and implement it on your front-end.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70709113/163850633-f3da5f8e-2527-4688-bc79-17233307a883.png)\n",

Simply provide your Stripe credentials and this plugin will open up a two-way communication channel between the two platforms. This enables you to easily sync data back and forth, as well as proxy the Stripe REST API through Payload's access control. Use this plugin to completely offload billing to Stripe and retain full control over your application's data.\n\nFor example, you might be building an e-commerce or SaaS application, where you have a `products` or a `plans` collection that requires either a one-time payment or a subscription. You can to tie each of these products to Stripe, then easily subscribe to billing-related events to perform your application's business logic, such as active purchases or subscription cancellations.\n\nTo build a checkout flow on your front-end you can either use [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/payments/checkout), or you can also build a completely custom checkout experience from scratch using [Stripe Web Elements](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/elements). Then to build fully custom, secure customer dashboards, you can leverage Payload's access control to restrict access to your Stripe resources so your users never have to leave your site to manage their accounts.\n\nThe beauty of this plugin is the entirety of your application's content and business logic can be handled in Payload while Stripe handles solely the billing and payment processing. You can build a completely proprietary application that is endlessly customizable and extendable, on APIs and databases that you own. Hosted services like Shopify or BigCommerce might fracture your application's content then charge you for access.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  This plugin is completely open-source and the [source code can be found here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/plugin-stripe).

If you think you've found a bug, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues/new?assignees=&labels=plugin%3A%20stripe&template=bug_report.md&title=plugin-stripe%3A) with as much detail as possible.\n</Banner>\n\n##### Core features\n\n- Hides your Stripe credentials when shipping SaaS applications\n- Allows restricted keys through [Payload access control](../access-control/overview)\n- Enables a two-way communication channel between Stripe and Payload\n- Proxies the [Stripe REST API](https://stripe.com/docs/api)\n- Proxies [Stripe webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks)\n- Automatically syncs data between the two platforms\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the plugin using any JavaScript package manager like [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), [NPM](https://npmjs.com), or [PNPM](https://pnpm.io):\n\n```bash\n  yarn add @payloadcms/plugin-stripe\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nIn the `plugins` array of your [Payload config](../configuration/overview), call the plugin with [options](#options):\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport stripePlugin from '@payloadcms/plugin-stripe'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    stripePlugin({\n      stripeSecretKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY,\n    }),\n  ],\n})\n\nexport default config\n```\n\n### Options\n\n| Option | Type | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `stripeSecretKey` \\* | string | `undefined` | Your Stripe secret key |\n| `stripeWebhooksEndpointSecret` | string | `undefined` | Your Stripe webhook endpoint secret |\n| `rest` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, opens the `/api/stripe/rest` endpoint |\n| `webhooks` | object \\| function | `undefined` | Either a function to handle all webhooks events, or an object of Stripe webhook handlers, keyed to the name of the event |\n| `sync` | array | `undefined` | An array of sync configs |\n| `logs` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, logs sync events to the console as they happen |\n\n_\\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._\n\n## Endpoints\n\nThe following custom endpoints are automatically opened for you:\n\n| Endpoint | Method | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `/api/stripe/rest` | `POST` | Proxies the [Stripe REST API](https://stripe.com/docs/api) behind [Payload access control](../access-control/overview) and returns the result. See the [REST Proxy](#stripe-rest-proxy) section for more details. |\n| `/api/stripe/webhooks` | `POST` | Handles all Stripe webhook events |\n\n##### Stripe REST Proxy\n\nIf `rest` is true, proxies the [Stripe REST API](https://stripe.com/docs/api) behind [Payload access control](../access-control/overview) and returns the result. If you need to proxy the API server-side, use the [stripeProxy](#node) function.\n\n```ts\nconst res = await fetch(`/api/stripe/rest`, {\n  method: 'POST',\n  credentials: 'include',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n    // Authorization: `JWT ${token}` // NOTE: do this if not in a browser (i.e. curl or Postman)\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    stripeMethod: 'stripe.subscriptions.list',\n    stripeArgs: [\n      {\n        customer: 'abc',\n      },\n    ],\n  }),\n})\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  The `/api` part of these routes may be different based on the settings defined in your Payload config.\n</Banner>\n\n## Webhooks\n\n[Stripe webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) are used to sync from Stripe to Payload. Webhooks listen for events on your Stripe account so you can trigger reactions to them. Follow the steps below to enable webhooks.\n\nDevelopment:\n\n1. Login using Stripe cli `stripe login`\n1. Forward events to localhost `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/stripe/webhooks`\n1. Paste the given secret into your `.env` file as `STRIPE_WEBHOOKS_ENDPOINT_SECRET`\n\nProduction:\n\n1. Login and [create a new webhook](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks/create) from the Stripe dashboard\n1. Paste `YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME/api/stripe/webhooks` as the \"Webhook Endpoint URL\"\n1. Select which events to broadcast\n1. Paste the given secret into your `.env` file as `STRIPE_WEBHOOKS_ENDPOINT_SECRET`\n1. Then, handle these events using the `webhooks` portion of this plugin's config:\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport stripePlugin from '@payloadcms/plugin-stripe'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    stripePlugin({\n      stripeSecretKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY,\n      stripeWebhooksEndpointSecret: process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOKS_ENDPOINT_SECRET,\n      webhooks: {\n        'customer.subscription.updated': ({ event, stripe, stripeConfig }) => {\n          // do something...\n        },\n      },\n      // NOTE: you can also catch all Stripe webhook events and handle the event types yourself\n      // webhooks: (event, stripe, stripeConfig) => {\n      //   switch (event.type): {\n      //     case 'customer.subscription.updated': {\n      //       // do something...\n      //       break;\n      //     }\n      //     default: {\n      //       break;\n      //     }\n      //   }\n      // }\n    }),\n  ],\n})\n\nexport default config\n```\n\nFor a full list of available webhooks, see [here](https://stripe.com/docs/cli/trigger#trigger-event).\n\n## Node\n\nOn the server you should interface with Stripe directly using the [stripe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stripe) npm module. That might look something like this:\n\n```ts\nimport Stripe from 'stripe'\n\nconst stripeSecretKey = process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY\nconst stripe = new Stripe(stripeSecretKey, { apiVersion: '2022-08-01' })\n\nexport const MyFunction = async () => {\n  try {\n    const customer = await stripe.customers.create({\n      email: data.email,\n    })\n\n    // do something...\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(error.message)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can interface with the Stripe using the `stripeProxy`, which is exactly what the `/api/stripe/rest` endpoint does behind-the-scenes. Here's the same example as above, but piped through the proxy:\n\n```ts\nimport { stripeProxy } from '@payloadcms/plugin-stripe'\n\nexport const MyFunction = async () => {\n  try {\n    const customer = await stripeProxy({\n      stripeSecretKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY,\n      stripeMethod: 'customers.create',\n      stripeArgs: [\n        {\n          email: data.email,\n        },\n      ],\n    })\n\n    if (customer.status === 200) {\n      // do something...\n    }\n\n    if (customer.status >= 400) {\n      throw new Error(customer.message)\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(error.message)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Sync\n\nThis option will setup a basic sync between Payload collections and Stripe resources for you automatically. It will create all the necessary hooks and webhooks handlers, so the only thing you have to do is map your Payload fields to their corresponding Stripe properties. As documents are created, updated, and deleted from either Stripe or Payload, the changes are reflected on either side.\n\n<Banner type=\"info\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  If you wish to enable a _two-way_ sync, be sure to setup [`webhooks`](#webhooks) and pass the `stripeWebhooksEndpointSecret` through your config.\n</Banner>\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\nimport stripePlugin from '@payloadcms/plugin-stripe'\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    stripePlugin({\n      stripeSecretKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY,\n      stripeWebhooksEndpointSecret: process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOKS_ENDPOINT_SECRET,\n      sync: [\n        {\n          collection: 'customers',\n          stripeResourceType: 'customers',\n          stripeResourceTypeSingular: 'customer',\n          fields: [\n            {\n              fieldPath: 'name', // this is a field on your own Payload config\n              stripeProperty: 'name', // use dot notation, if applicable\n            },\n          ],\n        },\n      ],\n    }),\n  ],\n})\n\nexport default config\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  <strong>Note:</strong>\n  <br />\n  Due to limitations in the Stripe API, this currently only works with top-level fields. This is because every Stripe object is a separate entity, making it difficult to abstract into a simple reusable library. In the future, we may find a pattern around this. But for now, cases like that will need to be hard-coded.\n</Banner>\n\nUsing `sync` will do the following:\n\n- Adds and maintains a `stripeID` read-only field on each collection, this is a field generated _by Stripe_ and used as a cross-reference\n- Adds a direct link to the resource on Stripe.com\n- Adds and maintains an `skipSync` read-only flag on each collection to prevent infinite syncs when hooks trigger webhooks\n- Adds the following hooks to each collection:\n  - `beforeValidate`: `createNewInStripe`\n  - `beforeChange`: `syncExistingWithStripe`\n  - `afterDelete`: `deleteFromStripe`\n- Handles the following Stripe webhooks\n  - `STRIPE_TYPE.created`: `handleCreatedOrUpdated`\n  - `STRIPE_TYPE.updated`: `handleCreatedOrUpdated`\n  - `STRIPE_TYPE.deleted`: `handleDeleted`\n\n## TypeScript\n\nAll types can be directly imported:\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  StripeConfig,\n  StripeWebhookHandler,\n  StripeProxy,\n  ...\n} from '@payloadcms/plugin-stripe/types';\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nThe [Templates Directory](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates) contains an official [E-commerce Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates/ecommerce) which demonstrates exactly how to configure this plugin in Payload and implement it on your front-end.

        "content": "\nBuilding your own plugin is easy, and if you&apos;re already familiar with Payload then you&apos;ll have everything you need to get started. You can either start from scratch or use the Payload plugin template to get up and running quickly.\n\n<Banner type=\"success\">\n  To use the template, run `npx create-payload-app@latest -t plugin -n my-new-plugin` directly in your terminal or [clone the template directly from GitHub](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload-plugin-template).\n</Banner>\n\nOur plugin template includes everything you need to build a full life-cycle plugin:\n\n* Example files and functions for extending the payload config\n* A local dev environment to develop the plugin\n* Test suite with integrated GitHub workflow\n\nBy abstracting your code into a plugin, you&apos;ll be able to reuse your feature across multiple projects and make it available for other developers to use.\n\n### Plugins Recap\n\nHere is a brief recap of how to integrate plugins with Payload, to learn more head back to the [plugin overview page](../plugins/overview).\n\n\n#### How to install a plugin\n\nTo install any plugin, simply add it to your Payload config in the plugins array.\n\n```\nimport samplePlugin from 'sample-plugin';\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    // Add plugins here\n    samplePlugin({\n\t\tenabled: true,\n    }),\n  ],\n});\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\n\n#### Initialization\n\nThe initialization process goes in the following order:\n\n1. Incoming config is validated\n2. Plugins execute\n3. Default options are integrated\n4. Sanitization cleans and validates data\n5. Final config gets initialized\n\n\n### Plugin Template\n\nIn the [Payload plugin template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload-plugin-template), you will see a common file structure that is used across plugins:\n\n1. root folder - general configuration\n2. /src folder - everything related to the plugin\n3. /dev folder - sanitized test project for development\n\n\n#### Root\n\nIn the root folder, you will see various files related to the configuration of the plugin. We set up our environment in a similar manner in Payload core and across other projects. The only two files you need to modify are:\n\n* **README**.md - This contains instructions on how to use the template. When you are ready, update this to contain instructions on how to use your Plugin.\n* **package**.json - Contains necessary scripts and dependencies. Overwrite the metadata in this file to describe your Plugin.\n\n\n#### Dev\n\nThe purpose of the **dev** folder is to provide a sanitized local Payload project. so you can run and test your plugin while you are actively developing it.\n\nDo **not** store any of the plugin functionality in this folder - it is purely an environment to _assist_ you with developing the plugin.\n\nIf you&apos;re starting from scratch, you can easily setup a dev environment like this:\n\n```\nmkdir dev\ncd dev\nnpx create-payload-app@latest\n```\n\nIf you&apos;re using the plugin template, the dev folder is built out for you and the `samplePlugin` has already been installed in `dev/payload.config()`.\n\n```\n  plugins: [\n    // when you rename the plugin or add options, make sure to update it here\n    samplePlugin({\n      enabled: false,\n    })\n  ]\n```\n\nYou can add to the `dev/payload.config` and build out the dev project as needed to test your plugin.\n\nWhen you&apos;re ready to start development, navigate into this folder with `cd dev`\n\nAnd then start the project with `yarn dev` and pull up `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.\n\n\n### Testing\n\nAnother benefit of the dev folder is that you have the perfect environment established for testing.\n\nA good test suite is essential to ensure quality and stability in your plugin. Payload typically uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/); a popular testing framework, widely used for testing JavaScript and particularly for applications built with React.\n\nJest organizes tests into test suites and cases. We recommend creating tests based on the expected behavior of your plugin from start to finish. Read more about tests in the [Jest documentation.](https://jestjs.io/)\n\nThe plugin template provides a stubbed out test suite at `dev/plugin.spec.ts` which is ready to go - just add in your own test conditions and you&apos;re all set!\n\n```\nimport payload from 'payload'\n\ndescribe('Plugin tests', () => {\n  // Example test to check for seeded data\n  it('seeds data accordingly', async () => {\n    const newCollectionQuery = await payload.find({\n      collection: 'newCollection',\n      sort: 'createdAt',\n    })\n\n    newCollection = newCollectionQuery.docs\n\n    expect(newCollectionQuery.totalDocs).toEqual(1)\n  })\n})\n```\n\n\n### Seeding data\n\nFor development and testing, you will likely need some data to work with. You can streamline this process by seeding and dropping your database - instead of manually entering data.\n\nIn the plugin template, you can navigate to `dev/src/server.ts` and see an example seed function.\n\n```\nif (process.env.PAYLOAD_SEED === 'true') {\n    await seed(payload)\n}\n```\n\nA sample seed function has been created for you at `dev/src/seed`, update this file with additional data as needed.\n\n```\nexport const seed = async (payload: Payload): Promise<void> => {\n  payload.logger.info('Seeding data...')\n\n  await payload.create({\n    collection: 'new-collection',\n    data: {\n      title: 'Seeded title',\n    },\n  })\n\n  // Add additional seed data here\n}\n\n```\n\n\n#### Src\n\nNow that we have our environment setup and dev project ready to go - it&apos;s time to build the plugin!\n\n\n**index.ts**\n\nFirst up, the `src/index.ts` file - this is where the plugin should be imported from. It is best practice not to build the plugin directly in this file, instead we use this to export the plugin and types from their respective files.\n\n\n**Plugin.ts**\n\nTo reiterate, the essence of a payload plugin is simply to extend the Payload config - and that is exactly what we are doing in this file.\n\n```\nexport const samplePlugin =\n  (pluginOptions: PluginTypes) =>\n  (incomingConfig: Config): Config => {\n    let config = { ...incomingConfig }\n\n   // do something cool with the config here\n\n    return config\n }\n```\n\n1. First, you need to receive the existing Payload config along with any plugin options.\n2. Then set the variable `config` to be equal to a copy of the existing config.\n3. From here, you can extend the config however you like!\n4. Finally, return the config and you&apos;re all set.\n\n\n### Spread Syntax\n\n[Spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) (or the spread operator) is a feature in JavaScript that uses the dot notation **(...)** to spread elements from arrays, strings, or objects into various contexts.\n\nWe are going to use spread syntax to allow us to add data to existing arrays without losing the existing data. It is crucial to spread the existing data correctly, else this can cause adverse behavior and conflicts with Payload config and other plugins.\n\nLet&apos;s say you want to build a plugin that adds a new collection:\n\n```\nconfig.collections = [\n  ...(config.collections || []),\n newCollection,\n  // Add additional collections here\n]\n```\n\nFirst, you need to spread the `config.collections` to ensure that we don&apos;t lose the existing collections. Then you can add any additional collections, just as you would in a regular payload config.\n\nThis same logic is applied to other properties like admin, globals, hooks:\n\n```\nconfig.globals = [\n  ...(config.globals || []),\n  // Add additional globals here\n]\n\nconfig.hooks = {\n  ...(config.hooks || {}),\n  // Add additional hooks here\n}\n```\n\nSome properties will be slightly different to extend, for instance the `onInit` property:\n\n```\nconfig.onInit = async payload => {\n  if (incomingConfig.onInit) await incomingConfig.onInit(payload)\n\n  // Add additional onInit code by using the onInitExtension function\n  onInitExtension(pluginOptions, payload)\n}\n```\n\nIf you wish to add to the `onInit`, you must include the async/await. We don&apos;t use spread syntax in this case, instead you must await the existing `onInit` before running additional functionality.\n\nIn the template, we have stubbed out a basic `onInitExtension` file that you can use, if not needed feel free to delete it.\n\n\n### Webpack\n\nIf any of your files use server only packages such as fs, stripe, nodemailer, etc, they will need to be removed from the browser bundle. To do that, you can [alias the file imports with webpack](../admin/excluding-server-code#aliasing-server-only-modules).\n\nWhen files are bundled for the browser, the import paths are essentially crawled to determine what files to include in the bundle. To prevent the server only files from making it into the bundle, we can alias their import paths to a file that can be included in the browser. This will short-circuit the import path crawling and ensure browser only code is bundled.\n\nWebpack is another part of the Payload config that can be a little more tricky to extend. To help here, the template includes a helper function `extendWebpackConfig()` which takes care of spreading the existing webpack, so you can just add your new stuff:\n\n```\nconfig.admin = {\n  ...(config.admin || {}),\n  // Add your aliases to the helper function below\n  webpack: extendWebpackConfig(incomingConfig)\n}\n```\n\n### Types\n\nIf your plugin has options, you should define and provide types for these options in a separate file which gets exported from the main `index.ts`.\n\n```\nexport interface PluginTypes {\n  /**\n   * Enable or disable plugin\n   * @default false\n   */\n  enabled?: boolean\n}\n\n```\n\nIf possible, include [JSDoc comments](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html#types-1) to describe the options and their types. This allows a developer to see details about the options in their editor.\n\n### Best practices\n\nIn addition to the setup covered above, here are other best practices to follow:\n\n##### Providing an enable / disable option:\nFor a better user experience, provide a way to disable the plugin without uninstalling it. This is especially important if your plugin adds additional webpack aliases, this will allow you to still let the webpack run to prevent errors.\n##### Include tests in your GitHub CI workflow:\nIf you&apos;ve configured tests for your package, integrate them into your workflow to run the tests each time you commit to the plugin repository. Learn more about [how to configure tests into your GitHub CI workflow.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-nodejs)\n##### Publish your finished plugin to NPM:\nThe best way to share and allow others to use your plugin once it is complete is to publish an NPM package. This process is straightforward and well documented, find out more about [creating and publishing a NPM package here](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages/).\n##### Add payload-plugin topic tag:\nApply the tag **payload-plugin** to your GitHub repository. This will boost the visibility of your plugin and ensure it gets listed with [existing payload plugins](https://github.com/topics/payload-plugin).\n##### Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer):\nWith the SemVer system you release version numbers that reflect the nature of changes (major, minor, patch). Ensure all major versions reference their Payload compatibility.\n",

This requires no changes to your front-end code and very few changes to your Payload config.\n\n![Versions](/images/docs/vercel-visual-editing.jpg)\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  Vercel Content Link is an enterprise-only feature and only available for deployments hosted on\n  Vercel. If you are an existing enterprise customer, [contact our sales\n  team](https://payloadcms.com/for-enterprise) for help with your integration.\n</Banner>\n\n### How it works\n\nTo power Vercel Content Link, Payload embeds Content Source Maps into its API responses. Content Source Maps are invisible, encoded JSON values that include a link back to the field in the CMS that generated the content. When rendered on the page, Vercel detects and decodes these values to display the Content Link interface.\n\nFor full details on how the encoding and decoding algorithm works, check out [`@vercel/stega`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/stega).\n\n### Getting Started\n\nSetting up Payload with Vercel Content Link is easy. First, install the `@payloadcms/plugin-csm` plugin into your project. This plugin requires an API key to install, [contact our sales team](https://payloadcms.com/for-enterprise) if you don't already have one.\n\n```bash\nnpm i @payloadcms/plugin-csm\n```\n\nThen in the `plugins` array of your Payload config, call the plugin and enable any collections that require Content Source Maps.\n\n```ts\nimport { buildConfig } from \"payload/config\"\nimport contentSourceMaps from \"@payloadcms/plugin-csm\"\n\nconst config = buildConfig({\n  collections: [\n    {\n      slug: \"pages\",\n      fields: [\n        {\n          name: 'slug',\n          type: 'text',\n        },\n        {\n          name: 'title,'\n          type: 'text',\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n  plugins: [\n    contentSourceMaps({\n      collections: [\"pages\"],\n    }),\n  ],\n})\n\nexport default config\n```\n\nNow in your Next.js app, include the `?encodeSourceMaps=true` parameter in any of your API requests. For performance reasons, this should only be done when in draft mode or on preview deployments.\n\n```ts\nif (isDraftMode || process.env.VERCEL_ENV === 'preview') {\n  const res = await fetch(\n    `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYLOAD_CMS_URL}/api/pages?where[slug][equals]=${slug}&encodeSourceMaps=true`,\n  )\n}\n```\n\nAnd that's it! You are now ready to enter Edit Mode and begin visually editing your content.\n\n##### Edit Mode\n\nTo see Content Link on your site, you first need to visit any preview deployment on Vercel and login using the Vercel Toolbar. When Content Source Maps are detected on the page, a pencil icon will appear in the toolbar. Clicking this icon will enable Edit Mode, highlighting all editable fields on the page in blue.\n\n![Versions](/images/docs/vercel-toolbar.jpg)\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n##### Dates\n\nThe plugin does not encode `date` fields by default, but for some cases like text that uses negative CSS letter-spacing, it may be necessary to split the encoded data out from the rendered text. This way you can safely use the cleaned data as expected.\n\n```ts\nimport { vercelStegaSplit } from '@vercel/stega'\nconst { cleaned, encoded } = vercelStegaSplit(text)\n```\n\n##### Blocks\n\nAll `blocks` fields by definition do not have plain text strings to encode. For this reason, blocks are given an additional `encodedSourceMap` key, which you can use to enable Content Link on entire sections of your site. You can then specify the editing container by adding the `data-vercel-edit-target` HTML attribute to any top-level element of your block.\n\n```ts\n<div data-vercel-edit-target>\n  <span style={{ display: \"none\" }}>{encodedSourceMap}</span>\n  {children}\n</div>\n```\n",

To interact with your cloud database, you will be provided with a MongoDB connection string. This can be found under the **Database** tab of your project.\n\n`mongodb+srv://your_connection_string`\n\n### File Storage\n\nPayload Cloud gives you S3 file storage backed by Cloudflare as a CDN, and this plugin extends Payload so that all of your media will be stored in S3 rather than locally.\n\nAWS Cognito is used for authentication to your S3 bucket. The [Payload Cloud Plugin](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-cloud) will automatically pick up these values. These values are only if you'd like to access your files directly, outside of Payload Cloud.\n\n#### Accessing Files Outside of Payload Cloud\n\nIf you'd like to access your files outside of Payload Cloud, you'll need to retrieve some values from your project's settings and put them into your environment variables. In Payload Cloud, navigate to the File Storage tab and copy the values using the copy button. Put these values in your .env file. Also copy the Cognito Password value separately and put into your .env file as well.\n\nWhen you are done, you should have the following values in your .env file:\n\n```env\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD=true\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD_ENVIRONMENT=prod\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD_COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID=\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD_BUCKET=\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD_BUCKET_REGION=\nPAYLOAD_CLOUD_COGNITO_PASSWORD=\n```\n\nThe plugin will pick up these values and use them to access your files.\n\n### Build Settings\n\nYou can update settings from your Project’s Settings tab. Changes to your build settings will trigger a redeployment of your project.\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nFrom the Environment Variables page of the Settings tab, you can add, update and delete variables for use in your project. Like build settings, these changes will trigger a redeployment of your project.\n\n<Banner>\n  Note: For security reasons, any variables you wish to provide to the Admin panel must be prefixed\n  with `PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_`.  Learn more\n  [here](../admin/webpack#admin-environment-vars).\n</Banner>\n\n### Custom Domains\n\nWith Payload Cloud, you can add custom domain names to your project. To do so, first go to the Domains page of the Settings tab of your project. Here you can see your default domain. To add a new domain, type in the domain name you wish to use.\n\n<Banner>\n  Note: do not include the protocol (http:// or https://) or any paths (/page). Only include the\n  domain name and extension, and optionally a subdomain. - your-domain.com - backend.your-domain.com\n</Banner>\n\nOnce you click save, a DNS record will be generated for your domain name to point to your live project. Add this record into your DNS provider’s records, and once the records are resolving properly (this can take 1hr to 48hrs in some cases), your domain will now to point to your live project.\n\nYou will also need to configure your Payload project to use your specified domain. In your `payload.config.ts` file, specify your `serverURL` with your domain:\n\n```ts\nexport default buildConfig({\n  serverURL: 'https://example.com',\n  // the rest of your config,\n})\n```\n\n### Email\n\nPowered by [Resend](https://resend.com), Payload Cloud comes with integrated email support out of the box. No configuration is needed, and you can use `payload.sendEmail()` to send email right from your Payload app. To learn more about sending email with Payload, checkout the [Email Configuration](../email/overview) overview.\n\nIf you are on the Pro or Enterprise plan, you can add your own custom Email domain name. From the Email page of your project’s Settings, add the domain you wish to use for email delivery. This will generate a set of DNS records. Add these records to your DNS provider and click verify to check that your records are resolving properly. Once verified, your emails will now be sent from your custom domain name.\n\n### Developing Locally\n\nTo make changes to your project, you will need to clone the repository defined in your project settings to your local machine. In order to run your project locally, you will need configure your local environment first. Refer to your repository’s `README.md` file to see the steps needed for your specific template.\n\nFrom there, you are ready to make updates to your project. When you are ready to make your changes live, commit your changes to the branch you specified in your Project settings, and your application will automatically trigger a redeploy and build from your latest commit.\n\n### Cloud Plugin\n\nProjects generated from a template will come pre-configured with the official Cloud Plugin, but if you are using your own repository you will need to add this into your project. To do so, add the plugin to your Payload config:\n\n`yarn add @payloadcms/plugin-cloud`\n\n```js\nimport { payloadCloud } from '@payloadcms/plugin-cloud'\nimport { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'\n\nexport default buildConfig({\n  plugins: [payloadCloud()],\n  // rest of config\n})\n```\n\n<Banner type=\"warning\">\n  **Note:** If your Payload config already has an email with transport, this will take precedence\n  over Payload Cloud's email service.\n</Banner>\n\n##### **Optional configuration**\n\nIf you wish to opt-out of any Payload cloud features, the plugin also accepts options to do so.\n\n```js\npayloadCloud({\n  storage: false, // Disable file storage\n  email: false, // Disable email delivery\n})\n```\n",
